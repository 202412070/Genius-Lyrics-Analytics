Me And The Boys In The Band,pop,Carly Rae Jepsen,2020,"[Verse 1]
On the road for half the year
And I can't remember loneliness
And it feels like that says something about you
Or something 'bout me
Performance and the after party
And it took a little time I guess
But I found that I'm not thinking about you
Or thinking 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we pack up, it's time to go
We'll do the whole damn thing tomorrow
In a new city, so pretty, let's go
Driving all night to make that show
I'll be a whole new girl tomorrow
It's a new city, so pretty, eyes closed

[Chorus]
We partied in the street last night
Got a little deep last night
In our feelings, yeah
And I got a little me last night
I danced in the street last night
With the boys in the band
Just me and the boys in the band
[Verse 2]
Now and then a memory sparks
Like violins still break my heart
And I feel that says something about you
Or something about me
One day we will meet as friends
But I am not good at pretending
You were so good at pretending

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, but now I pack up, it's time to go
We'll do the whole damn thing tomorrow
In a new city, so pretty, let's go

So just take me to the stage
It's been home from the start
Summer nights, summer days

Untamed Region,pop,Jenny Hval,2016,"[Intro]
It sums up the strange mood of our time when nothing really makes any coherent sense. We live with a constant vaudeville of contradictory stories that makes it impossible for any real opposition to emerge, because they can't counter it with a coherent narrative of their own. And it means that we as individuals become ever more powerless, unable to challenge anything because we live in a state of confusion and uncertainty

[Verse 1]
I'm in a big house, having big dreams
The next time I wake up there's blood on the bed
Didn't know it was time yet
Or is it not mine?
I feel old in this hotel
As if surprised to find I still have it in me
And yet so young
Hollow
Unsure if from young or old
I dip my finger in it
Smells like warm winter
Then I feel the need to touch everything
Everything in this room
Like a dog I'm marking everything that belongs to no-one
Bringing it close to me, or life, or something
I have big dreams
And blood powers
My own art history
My combined failures",5375,54067
Everything,pop,Diamond Eyes,2018,"[Verse 1]
I'm on my own, broke and alone
I feel the rain crashing down
All around this empty town

Keep moving like the scars aren't even there
It's in the air, like a prism flare
Just stay cause the flames will burn us

I thought you were the one for me
That's why I gave you everything
Held you close by the stormy seas

[Verse 2]
My darling dear, you're never here
When I'm in pain you hide and disappear
Like shadows in the atmosphere
Charming the stratosphere, yeah
I prayed for you, and catch you near
In hopes you'd chase away my fears
I'm on my own, you made it so
And now I'm chasing nightmares through your pain

I used to run with you through the great big leaves
Laugh at you when you laugh at me
Hope for us because I believed
That home was just you and me

Oh, you were waiting for me, you saw me, adored me
As I wish the whole world would
You would never hurt me, desert me or work me
For all the things you thought you could

How I missed you when I was gone
Hurt me so to leave you, deceive you, I needed you

Reasons to Stay,pop,Kate Vogel,2019,"[Verse 1]
I've been driving around here in this town
Know it like the back of my hand
I've been dreaming of ways, ways to get out
Put myself in a box that I'd never be
Someone I'm proud of you see
Here I am on this bridge facing defeat

[Chorus]
I'm just doing the best I can
I'm just living the life I have
I'm confused but I'm fine with that
The beauty will outweigh the pain
From the chill of the autumn wind
And the laugh of your sister's kid
To the first snow when it sets in
The beauty will outweigh the pain
We'll all find a purpose one day
There's so many reasons to stay

No I don't wanna die, just don't wanna live
Why can't I reach out for help
You would do anything to get me through this

To let someone into my mind
But I'd do anything just to survive

Leaves,pop,Ben&Ben,2017,"[Verse 1]
I can think of all the times
You told me not to touch the light
I never thought that you would be the one

How you even thought it could be right
'Cause everything we cherished is gone
And in the end can you me tell me if
It was worth the try, so I can decide

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time

Try as hard as I might
To flee the shadows of the night
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
But how can I try to hide
When every breath and every hour
I still end up thinking of you
And in the end everything we have makes it worth the fight
So I will hold on for as long

That I'd decide if I should leave or stay

And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Wounds of the past will eventually heal

It was good most of the time

Windswept,pop,Crywolf,2016,"[Verse 1]
On that night under the staircase
Our arms drifting down
Your kiss made me a believer
Cleansed my sins somehow

I'll be what you need
I'll keep you inside my fortress
Hand you the keys
Leave you to roam these walls

But you tore down the keep
I returned to find ruins
You left all my love in the rubble with these walls

[Verse 2]
But in my head
I am still there, I can still feel you
Breathing slow
I've known this dream for a long time
In the air, suspended here
With thousands of words we've spoken
Can I soar up through the clouds?
Leave all of this behind?

[Verse 3]
But in my head
I am still there, I can still feel you
Breathing slow
I've known this dream for a long time

All alone
I feel your breath, I hear your whispers
Dark like storms
Telling me, ""Dear, I'll never leave your mind""

[Verse 4]
And you've been there all along
Tugging me, pulling me down
Touching him, holding him close
You've made your home

And I see your face through his eyes
With every move of your hips
You're breaking my bones
While holding me hostage

Could I still love you
Though my arms are breaking?
Could we still be alone?

Do I still know you?
Are you still my answer
To the question I've asked since I was born?",23839,16529

Out of My Head,pop,Axel Mansoor,2017,"Look at the location where the bullet penetrated my younger self
I tend to it, talk to it, take care to nurse it back to health
Look at my location it's a better iteration of a constant hell
Where we review review review, no one likes those parts of you still, cause

Bears an inhibition
Call this a mutiny
Cause I’m taking back control I’m saying

You need to get out of my head
You need to get out of my head
You need to get out of my head

How could I have held the notion that
Something good would come out of this habit of
Disconnecting from the center?

How could I have held the notion that
Something good would be looking my way
Out of the corner of my mind?

Confined in escape on burnt grass
Below the crest, lier in wait for the ending

But if you love me still then stay
Don't keep me waiting for that final kiss

Or we could work through it apart

That you will always have my heart

Not all bad
Whole time been inside of my bag

Get texts from ya at the worst times when I'm all alone
And you talk like there's no history before

Fuck with my headtop, leave you undone
Both learned some shit and then changed up, don't need no one
Done made mistakes, those mistakes were dumb
Now I drown the stress and anxiety into my lungs

The Art of the Possible,pop,Andrew Lloyd Webber,1976,"[PERÓN & MILITARY]
One has no rules
Is not precise
One rarely acts
The same way twice
One spurns no device
Practicing the art of the possible

One always picks
The easy fight
One praises fools
One smothers light
One shifts left to right
It's part of the art of the possible

[EVA]
I'm only a radio star with just one weekly show
But speaking as one of the people, I want you to know
We are tired of the decline of
Argentina with no sign of
A government able to give us the things we deserve
[MILITARY]
One always claims
Mistakes were planned
When risk is slight
One takes one's stand
With much sleight of hand
Politics - the art of the possible

One has no rules
Is not precise
One rarely acts
The same way twice
One spurns no device
Politics - the art of the possible

All Choked Up,pop,Say Anything,2001,"Thank God I don't think out loud
Too many thoughts in my head
Right now
Mostly concerning the moonlight
As it dances across your neck. I'm out of practice
And you smell like roses. I'm the mortal soldier
Your queen of hearts
All that I want is to show you how you you're nothing like all of them tell you
To be more than just a cricket on your shoulder
A little closer

Feelings choke me
Don't let me leave without a word
I'll never give in
I've been letting my mind win the war with my heart again. You are timeless
I am a fool in love with time

I've always believed in you
Want to be more than that tonight
And live for the moment
But that takes too much pride. You will say what I never have
I'd shape up and put on weight
Cross out my calendar marked to the date where we'd meet on some mystic veranda
To dance I'd show you skills. I'm not forgotten. I'd spoil you rotten
So Don't be afraid
For better or worse
Lets dive
Head first we can think about this later when were not so jaded. So jaded
I can't go on the way I've gone forever. A new endeavor is oh so needed and

Feelings scare you
You never look me in the eye
Don't ever change I just want you to know the complacencies always been staged
I was blinded until you opened up my eyes
I've always believed in you

Want to be more than that tonight
And live for the moment
But that takes too much pride
You will say what I.. Never had if I tried
Damned if I don't. What if I died without being with you
I can try all I want
The feelings would taunt saying 'loser we see through you.' And forgive me love
These thoughts are not my own
They were put in my mind by aliens
To keep me home alone. And forgive me love
For wanting you. Blame it on those eyebrows arching over baby blues
Oh you. Oh you.....
And live for the moment but that takes too much pride
You will say what I never have
Oh can you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
Do you see Me now?
Could you save me now?
Do you hear me now?
Could you see me now?
Could you save me now?

Fabrizio De Andrè - La Guerra Di Piero English Translation,pop,Genius English Translations,1968,"Lying down buried in a field of rye
't's neither the rose's nor the tulip's eye
Watching your sleep in the ditches' ol' bed
But it's a thousand red poppies instead

""Down by the banks of the stream in my town
I want the silvery pikes to swim down
No more the corpses of soldiers laid low
Carried along by the slithering flow""

That's what you said during Winter's cold kiss
And like the others straight toward the abyss
Sadly you go forth like someone who must
Wind's spitting snow in your face with a gust

Pete you should stop now, stop right away
Let the wind blow on your skin while you may
Let it relay you the voice of the dead
Who gave his life got a cross back instead

You did not hear it though time just went by
Along with the seasons you'd march in a line
Till you arrived at the border gateway
It was a pleasant and sunny Spring day
While you were marching your soul on your back
Y'spotted a man in the valley's dark crack
Inside he was feeling exactly like you
Except that his uniform differed in hue

Shoot him now Pete with the shotgun you bore
Fire one shot and then keep shooting more
Till you will see him drop down in the mud
Flat on the ground on top of his blood

""Now if I aim at his heart or his head
I'll leave him time just to see that he's dead
But I'll have time to look down where he lies
See for the first time a dying man's eyes""

While you reflect on a kind way to kill
The other one sees you and turns in a chill
Taken his gun he gets ready to fight
Pulls on the trigger, not quite as polite

Y'dropped on the pavement without a moan
And understood in a moment alone
You would not have enough time to pray for
God to forgive all the sins that you bore

Y'dropped on the pavement without a moan
And understood in a moment alone
That your own life was to end on that day
And that this journey was only one-way
""My little Janet it's over today
Don't have the guts to be dying in May
My little Janet, descending to hell
Would have been better in Winter's cold spell""

And while the rye would its ears to you lend
'Gainst your own shotgun your arms you would bend
'Gainst your own teeth came out words of defeat
Far too ice-cold to dissolve in the heat

Lying down buried in a field of rye
't's neither the rose's nor the tulip's eye
Watching your sleep in the ditches' ol' bed
But it's a thousand red poppies instead",5111,56220

It Started with a Love Affair,pop,Jerry Williams,1989,"In July of '62
The moment we met
My summer with you
I'll never forget

I was looking to find
Someone carin' like you
When I think of the time
Feelin' lonely and blue didn't know what to do

Ah Oh Oh

It started with a love affair
You showed me how to really care
With you I travel everywhere
If you feel the same only call my name
I'll be there

They play it now again
Our favorite song
It's still the same the refrain
Despite the years have gone
I was lucky to find
Someone carein' like you
When I think of the time
Feelin' lonely and blue didn't know what to do

It started with a love affair
You showed me how to really care
With you I travel everywhere
If you feel the same only call my name
I'll be there

Someone careing like you

I Cant Save the World If Im Not Happy,pop,Eliza Grace,2018,"[Verse 1]
In my head, like I said
With all the battles that I've fought
I'm still steady in my thoughts

And I'm quiet and I get silent
Because there's still something to defend
When nothing is my friend

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't calm your wrists with a razor blade
And you can't pay the price of what's already paid
And you can't fight for peace with ambition, blood, and gore
And I can't save the world if I'm not happy anymore

In the weakest corners of my mind
I've played in minor keys at more minor times
Just filling the hole in my skull
Filling the hole in my skull
I cross my fingers over corners of my mind
It's 11:11 and it's alright
Just filling the hole in my skull
(Just filling the hole)

Among the trees I have spent all my summers in a haze
Of lazy afternoons, watching all the rain
As it patterns the verandah, then disappears again
Come the sun...

How I wish I could return to those summers once again
How I wish I could just sit in the presence of a friend
Making music or just listening to the birds so far from sight
Watching as the dark shades of evening turn to night
Gone the sun...

Among the trees I have lain and passed my golden days
Among the trees I have spent all my summers in a haze
Of lazy afternoons, watching all the rain
As it patterns the verandah, then disappears again

It becomes longing clearly

Why are you still there

Notes About Freedom,pop,Act II,2005,"[Intro]
The words you're about to hear are probably sincere
Although extracted from some diary pot-hooks (Yeah?)
Yeah, they're all about a couple of weary, pissed off
Hassled ramblers I was pleased to know (Oh)
But I guess I should admit that it's written all to fit
The senses from my personal outlooks (Mhm)
It's just a sort of a— (What?)
I said it was just a rough selection, but here we go

[Verse 1]
The first one to meet, an extraordinary neat
And determined all Canadian mother
For sure she was a bit from home now
And she wouldn't mind
She was fighting like a man, when she couldn't understand
That sometimes people have to bother
The word that could describe her manners is not refined

[Chorus]
These are only notes about freedom
I wish you had the time to read them
Speaking about freedom, what's that like?
Rolling a joint, go for a hike
Missing the point, renting a bike?
(Ah, ooh, alright)
(Alright, alright, alright)
[Verse 3]
The next one is the grass man, picking up his brass can
Telling us it's mighty splendid
Showing us the latest harvest of Sumatra grass
Coming from the highland, heading for the island
Where the crop is very much demanded
The heads are waiting there to see him, ""It's gonna be a mass""

[Chorus]
These are only notes about freedom
I wish you had the time to read them
Speaking about freedom, what's that like?
Rolling a joint, go for a hike
Missing the point, renting a bike?
(Ah, ooh, alright)
(Alright, alright, alright)

[Verse 4]
Time lapse, looking for the tabs
You know would make you feel much better?
Lead into a state you're missing when you're drinking wine
Looking at the sun, nothing has been done (Ooh)
Time to write yourself a letter (Ooh)
This diary will steal an hour, but you've sure got time (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Oh, these are only notes about freedom
I wish you had the time to read them
Speaking about freedom, what's that like?
Rolling a joint, go for a hike
Missing the point, renting a bike?
(Ah, ooh, alright)
(Alright, alright, alright)

Oh, these are only notes about freedom

But stuck in my head is a picture of you
You were the thunder, I was the rain
I wanna know if I'll see you again
I said ""I love you,"" you said ""goodbye""
Everything changes in the blink of an eye
It's been a while, I still carry the flame
I wanna know, will I see you again?
See you again, see you again
Want you to know what you mean to me
What will it take, take you to see?

I could put a little stardust in your eyes
Put a little sunshine in your life
Give me a little hope you feel the same
And I wanna know, will I see you again?
Will I see you again?

I feel like a fool, 'cause you’re not even there
I’m writing this song, and you don’t even care

I've been fallin' backwards, runnin' barefoot through the leaves
I could bite my tongue until I really gotta leave
If the issue isn't settled, why you settlin' for me?
Hey you
Whatchu wanna be?
I remember back when I was sleeping with no sheets
Back when we were struggling off 89 a week
When the habits I possessed was partially possessing me
When the root of all my problеms disappeared inside thе green
And I was acting like I gave a fuck but no one fucked with me
When the busses to the 6 were all I had just to be free
I got a passport for that bitch but but now I travel overseas
Yeah, it's been a couple years but honestly it's all I see
When I close my eyes and reminisce this shit is just a dream
Guess I really overcame a lot and now I've come to see
All the work I've put into it paying off by 23
Thought I'd never live to tell but now I'm tellin' how it be
When you overcome the obstacles and turn into a G
You could A. run for cover, are you ready for the heat?
Self-destruct until I feel like anyone but me
You could be anything that you desire, whatchu seek?
I've been plotting on this shit for years since I was seventeen
Never felt like I could do it, the depression come in sweeps
I put my headphones on and spit some shit until I fall asleep
Back in 2017, I plotted out my death
Tied a noose inside my closet, drew a target on my chest
If you think this shit's a gimmick, you can put it to the test
Check my browser history for all the answers, be my guest
Googled ""how to kill myself"" but every option involved pain
Every forum full of isolated kids that feel the same
Saying they would end their lives in hopes of ridding all the shame
It's much easier to talk about when no one knows your name
It's hilarious how motherfuckers profit off an act
You ain't ever put the blade against your skin and that's a fact
You're bewildered by the concept of a struggle so you cap
Yeah, my eyes are fixed upon you and I'm ready to attack

Yeah, guess this is a wrap

Two Face,pop,Jake Daniels,2020,"[Intro]
Boo!

[Verse 1]
Lately I’ve been talking with a ghost
He tells me all the places I should go
He makes me paint my face so that I know
That I’m not the only the person in my soul

He tells me that a monster lives inside
And when It gets too angry I should hide
Cause if I were to try and pick a fight
I would barely stand a chance and I’d die

[Pre-Chorus]

Two face call me Harvey
Never know when it could change
Tried to talk to my reflection but he said he wants my name

[Chorus 1]
Wake up the beast
Bury the bones
Enjoy the feast
Take all control
When I give you my soul
[Verse 2]
Devils on my shoulder
Got an aching down my spine
Feel like chains are getting heavy
But I don’t know which are mine?

Can you save me?
Am I lost?
Is it Time to take me
From all of these thoughts

Two face call me Harvey
Never know when it could change
Tried to talk to my reflection but he said he wants my name

Figure Me Out,pop,The Summer Set,2016,"[Verse 1]
I'm a bit too pop for the punk kids
But I'm too punk for the pop kids
I don't know just where I fit in
'Cause when I open my mouth
I know nobody's listenin'
To the words of a prophet
Who still can't turn a profit
'Cause I don't fit in with the in crowd
But I'm too Hollywood to go back to my hometown

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they think that I'm famous
When I know I'm a fraud
Who got too fucked up on the finer things
To remember who he forgot

[Chorus]
But I believe there's more to life than all my problems
Maybe there's still hope for me to start again
I'll get my feet back on the ground
And pull my head out of the clouds
I think it's time for me to figure me out
[Verse 2]
So let's get back to the basics
And take it back to the basement
Where I heard ""Born To Run"" for the first time
And I stared at my dad in amazement
He said, ""Son don't stop chasing great
And keep pounding the pavement.""
So I'd much rather die tryin' to make something sacred
Than live as another YouTube sensation

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I hate that they're famous
For being something they're not
While I'm too hung up on the things I don't have
To appreciate what I've got

[Chorus]
But I believe there's more to life than all my problems
Maybe there's still hope for me to start again
I'll get my feet back on the ground
And pull my head out of the clouds
I think it's time for me to figure me out

Time for me to figure me out
Time for me to figure me out
So if you hear this song, turn it up real loud

Alright, if you hear this song, turn it up real loud
'Cause it's time for me to figure me out

I believe there's more to life than all my problems

So I can make my parents proud
Hope my feet don't fail me now

Isnt This a Lovely Day?,pop,Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong,1956,"The weather is fright'ning
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So i can honestly say
That as far as i'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke and oh
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Though we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and i
Could be cozy and warm
Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
Long as I can be with you it's a lovely day

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea

If Im The Only One,pop,Rodney Carrington,2009,"We fell in love and got married back in 1993
And people said you had a rocky past; it never mattered to me
You say I'm the only one but there's pictures on our wall
Of you and your ex-boyfriend kissing at the mall

If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come you still talk to him?
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come our baby looks just like Tim?
Just asking questions I don't mean to pry
You got all the answers so baby just tell me why
If I'm the only one you ever loved
Who's underwear are these?
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come you got so many Mardi Gras beads?
You say that I'm the only one you loved

You didn't come home the other night you said you had to work late
I came by your office with some cookies I baked
I walked in and I saw him and his hands were in your hair
And both your feet were pointed in the air
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come your boss is all over you?
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come his pants are down around his shoes?
Just asking questions I don't mean to pry
You got all the answers so baby just tell me why

I just need an explanation so I can understand
Why when I came home last night there was a naked man
Running across our land with his clothes in his hand
He ran...

If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come your name's on the bathroom wall?
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come it says ""for a good time, call""?
You say that I'm the only one you loved
But you spent the night on 50 Cent's tour bus
How am I the only one you ever loved?",2646,92178

Only You, only You, only You

And told the waters to be still
Who spoke to form the universe

Sound His praise
As all His people adore

And He will fill it with praise

Above all names is Jesus

High sounding cymbals
And trumpets of brass
The sound of one accord

A new song in my heart
It's a song of praise to my God
And everyone who
Hears it will rejoice

It's always like this, you are you, me is me

Cellphone is just accessory
Am I really your boyfriend? I’m sick
Why do you put off your feelings like homework?
Are we doing business? Or do you hate me?
Be more affectionate
Today I put a spell on you again

We're like parallel lines, looking at the same spot but so different
You're the only one I have
But why do I feel like you're not there

Have you ever done anything to make me down?
You're cute and I'm just pathetic
Hope a miracle happens so that you love me more than I love you

One day I walked out the door
Just like every guy before
And I think that makes you want me more
But revenge is all you’ve come to know
We got way too close
And so I ran away when I saw the rope
Now you haunt me like some kind of ghost
Can’t get rid of you baby

[Verse 1]
You could say that it was paradise
We were making love with crazy eyes
I was so into the passion so I let it happen as you tied my hands so tight
Next thing I know
You’re name’s like a parasite on my phone
Demanding me to tell you everywhere I go
Like some kind of bitch that you own, no

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’m sorry for the pain I’ve caused
But without you I’ve been so much better off
At least that’s what I thought

One day I walked out the door

Can’t get rid of you baby

Paranoid thoughts in my head
Your voice your face a spiderweb
Maybe it’s my conscience it don’t do often
But I swear I still smell your breath in my bed
Waiting for the moment that you make me pay
For being so inviting just to go astray
Wanted something casual, some fun, some play
But you made it pretty clear you had to have it your way

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’m sorry but you’ve gotta learn
That real love isn’t forced it’s something you and I both gotta earn

Can’t get rid of you baby
[Bridge]
I can tell you’re hurt
And it’s made you insecure
Never knowing what you’re worth
So you wake up in my shirt
Getting overly attached
With the demons on your back
Tryna let go of the past
So you move in way too fast yeah
I can tell you’re hurt
But it’s something like a curse
Cuz it only makes it worse
Letting people be the cure
When they start to let you go (oh)
You’re on overload (oh)
Stuck in psycho mode
Thinking you’re invisible
(But you follow 'em like a ghost)

The light streams, I've stepped into a movie scene
Where my secrets are written on the bathroom walls
It dropped clean, like a penny in a slot machine
I know that I want this so

The moment in time when our shadows collided and I told the truth
You linked through my fingers and followed me into the hall of mirrors (Hall of mirrors)

And now and then I’ll be running round the bend
Signed ""Live this fucking life, shut your eyes”
Then I’ll dig myself a trench, thorns at my bedside
Writing letters that are riddled with regret
I said I know, I know, I know, I know your heart is locked
And this can only be inside the dream that I’ve been making up

But he's the last domain
Of a very black, back room brain
He learned a word today
The word's misanthropy
And he's running to and from
The cats from tin pan alley
And he's running with and from
The cats from tin pan alley
And going down the alley
Take the cats from the alley
Up to them
The alley's full of cats from tin pan

As Tall as Cliffs,pop,Margot & the Nuclear So and So's,2008,"I tell tales tall as cliffs

All your weekends lost by the lake
Where you said I needn't be afraid
Of all those devils on the wall
That make a fella small
When he's feelin' brave
They take his wine away
There were posters on the wall
I swear my mother saw
That I'd been up all night, up all night

And you came well-equipped
With a gun on your hip
And some poison on your lips
But when we wake up in our makeup
We'll be clean
And we won't have nowhere to be

I've been tellin' lies

A Part of That,pop,Anna Kendrick,2015,"[Cathy]
One day we're just like
""Leave It to Beaver.""
One day it's just a
Typical life
And then he's off on
A trip to Jamie-land:
Staring catatonic out the window
Barely even breathing all the while…

And then he'll smile
His eyes light up, and deep within the ground
Without a sound
A moment comes to life
And I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that

Next day it's just like
It never happened –
We're making dinners
We're making plans
Then he gets on the
Mule train to Jamie-land:
Handful after handful of Doritos
Circling the apartment, logging miles…
And then he smiles
His eyes light up, and how can I complain?
Yes, he's insane
But look what he can do
And I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that…

And it's true
I tend to follow in his stride
Instead of side by side
I take his cue
True, but there's no question, there's no doubt –
I said I'd stick it out
And follow through
And when I do –

Then he smiles
And where else can I go?
I didn't know
The rules do not apply
And then he smiles
And nothing else makes sense
While he invents
The world that's passing by
And I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that
Aren't I?
I'm a part of that
I'm a part of that

And standing at the edge of your front lawn
Me and my only one

Suck it up and spit it back
Won't follow your rules - oh no
Where's the problem - oh no oh no
Tough shtick won't follow your rules - oh no
I feel it coming - oh no

Rainy march night do you think I can make it through
Sorry to drop this all on you don't even answer - it's cool
Cloudy weeks float by through an eggplant sky and I'm an April fool
The hell did I do?

A Fine Day to Die,pop,Emperor,1994,"Orgy of silence, conspiracy of peace
Only the sound of the cold northern breeze
Twinsun sink fading behind the black lake
Asleep is the mountains, yet the night is awake

Strange is the night. Now black stars rise
And many Moons circle through silent the night

Along the black mountainside, scattered
By the campfires awaiting the dawn
Two times a hundred men in battles
Tried by the steel in the arrow, axe and the sword

By battle worn, hunger torn, awaiting
For the Sun to break through the cold haze
And for the banners of Ebal to appear
On the hill in the Sun's first warm rays

The elder among the men looked deep into
The fire and spoke loud with pride
Tomorrow is a fine day to die
(Guitar solo)

Now the morning advance from far East
Now the Sun breaks through dustclouds and haze
Now a forest of spears appears on the hill
And steel shines bright in the Sun's first rays

Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here

And search my soul for a paradise

Get The Money,pop,Goran Bregovi,1993,"Hey lucky people, North and South
This is your leader, I'm called the mouth
We're gonna play a game that's funny
Get the, get the, get the money

Money, money, money, money, money
Money, money

Walking on the beach, all disenchanted
Blackness in my heart
Anything they want now, they can't stop me,energy goes dead
Riviera buildings, high, depressing
Look like cookie boxes
In my heart a huricane is blowing
In my head a clock ticks
Tic-tack

Get the money, Mr. Potato
Get the money, pay the Eskimo

Money, money, money, money, money
ABC
Schoolboys, schoolgirls, don't make funny
Take a deep breath, get the money

Money, money, money, money, money

A lot of neigbourhood, oncrete and windows
Uphere on the mountain
I wonder if somebody sees me walking
I could hide in that fountain
Pretty little girl, I like to know her, coming this way
Back in school, I can't believe that I could not obey

Get the money, Mr. Potato
Get the money, pay the Eskimo

Money, money, money, money, money

Crawl on your belly, bust your skull
There's the money, real as hell

William Tell

Money, money, money, money, money
Money, money
I met an actor, river speed boat
He made crabby movies
Robin Maxwell had a yacht
But it didn't die so groovy

Me, I confess, I like to swim and
Watch the telly,my news
I've been hanging 'round the beach
But the money pays my kwanos

Get the money, Mr. Potato
Get the money, pay the Eskimo

Money, money, money, money, money

It's kind of like a fortress, it's kind of like a tomb
Sitting with your money in a near dark room

Feels like a discharge, feels like a death
Feels like a taste of dying breath

Feels like a toad, feels like a frog
Feels like a serpent, all night long",2047,111360
If I Build A Home On The Moon,pop,Picture This,2020,"[Verse 1]
If I build a home on the moon
I'll keep a crater for you

When you look out your window at night
You'll send me a star to say, ""Hi"" and ""Goodbye""
And ""Hello again""

You'll remember the days and the nights
That we had, and we'll have again

When I build a home on the moon
I'll bring a TV for you
So you don't ever miss out
On the world's stupid problems
And I'll never want you to leave
'Cause no ones gonna believe
That you're dating a guy
Who lives on another planet
Another planet
That doesn't happen

Standing Still,pop,Roman Lob,2012,"Guess we knew this was coming on
Cause you're already gone in my head
You can tell me that I'm wrong
That you're staying with me instead
When winter's come along
And summer's dead and gone
Is there anything left here to say?
I can put my arms around
The emptiness I found
And find a way to make you stay

But I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you leave me now
I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you're walking out
Yeah, I'm just standing still
Now before I felt so strong
And pieces of me break so easy
What I thought would be the end
Is just the feeling that you freed me
Girl, this ain't giving up
It's knowing where to stop
Knowing when a thing is over
I know my life is blind
See for the first time
This ain't gonna bring us closer

Cause I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you leave me now
Yeah, I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you're walking out

I'm standing still

[Verse 1]
I walk among the trees in the evening
Shadows that have opened in my mind
A heaviness slows my breathing
Somehow it speeds up time
Ascending from a cold stone wall
With jagged rocks cutting as I climb
Fading as I softly fall
Whisper to me where I lie

[Chorus]
I’ll still love you when the morning comes
The morning never felt so bad
Do you ever really think about me?
The morning never felt so...
I’ll still love you when the moon it falls
You whisper to my wounded soul
So bitter but it tastes so sweet
[Verse 2]
I swam through a river I saw
Swimming under glass sheets three feet deep
I guess that’s why I didn’t hear you call
Caught up in emotions I can’t speak
Dear lover I am all exposed
Illuminated in your glow
I always knew I’d end up alone
Forever haunted by your ghost

[Chorus]
I’ll still love you when the morning comes
The morning never felt so bad
Do you ever really think about me?
The morning never felt so
I’ll still love you when the moon it falls
You whisper to my wounded soul
So bitter but it tastes so sweet

[Bridge]
Your love is a poison arrow through my heart
I try in vain to elude it
You paint me in your picture, distill me in your art
A heavy brush won’t remove it

[Chorus]
I’ll still love you when the morning comes
The morning never felt so bad
Do you ever really think about me?
The morning never felt so
I’ll still love you when the moon it falls
You whisper to my wounded soul
So bitter but it tastes so sweet",2928,85504
Bring The Rain,pop,Finish Ticket,2013,"[Verse 1]
The days may change
With the length of your hair, the clothes that you wear
But you're still some kid
And you're farther from home
Than ever before

You grow tired
In your search for salvation
A hunt for your place in this world
You know it birthed you
It molds you and it tears you apart

[Pre-Chorus]
It's out, out, out with the old
And it's in with the new
We want back, back, back to the old
Just a lonely few

Singing bring the rain to my front door
Bring a thundering sky
Tame the fires that burn the walls
Of a life that waves goodbye

The weeks are drawn as they fit to a song
Oh and the frustration
The cause within sight
My teeth chip as I bite

And it's in with the new
We want back, back, back to the old

What have I become?
Just another one
Away from home
Something takes my hand
And my feet won't walk along
New hopes tower us
And our eyes were doors
But they walked right through
And it's haunting us
It's the only home we've known

Bring the rain to my front door
Bring a thundering sky
Tame the fires that burn the walls
Of a life that waves goodbye

Bring the rain to my front door
Bring a thundering sky

And let me peer inside
Let me in where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind as you do mine

You have lost too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust, it's not enough
You just threw away the key to your heart
You don't get burned 'cause nothing gets through
It makes it easier, easier on you
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see

Love ain't fair
So there you are, my love

Know I'm not what you want
And I'm not coming back

Each little wasp that stings

He made their horrid wings

All evil great and small
All things foul and dangerous

Who made the sharks? He did!

He Was a Good Friend,pop,Francis and the Lights,2007,"Wasn't it just last year we were in the very same position?
You sat me down on the cold floor
You said that this time, I don't think she's coming back
Now I always thought she was alright
Something about the way she looked me in the eyes
And people always said we saw things the same way
So I think you'll be just fine

But I don't think she's coming back this time, this time

Wasn't it just last year we were in the very same position?
That's when I told you you've never been anything but good to me
So when two knocks rang out on my door
I swear to God I told you the very same thing
I said I, I don't really wanna talk about it, no no
He was a good friend of mine
Maybe you should go out and put on some fresh clothes, man
See a movie

Stronger Than You - Frisk Version,pop,XandulsBored,2019,"I didn't know what I got into
Somehow I can't go back
Even if I really wanted to
So what more can I do
Here, in the end, it just me and you
I never wanted to play by all the rules
A knife in hand
I'm playing out the part of the fool
So here we go
You can judge me thoroughly
It's too late for apologies

So go ahead and just hit me since you're able
We know my determination is unstable
I'm not even mad because I keep on dying
But I don't even know why I'm trying

This isn't what I want
But it's what I asked for
Curiosity over all my morals
I took away our perfect happy ending
Resetting the world dispute the warnings
Right now I'm made
Of LOVE, of LOVE, of LOVE
I know who you are
You remember who I am
We know that once in a timeline
We had grown to be good friends
And yet I killed your brother
Without giving him a chance
Every time you throw me down
I hope you kill me once again

So go ahead and just hit me since you're able
All the sin that I can feel is unbearable
If I could only hit you once it would be over
But the consequences last forever

The flowers are in bloom
As the birds will tell
It's a beautiful day to be burning in hell
You gave me advice
I choose genocide
But I know how to make it right

I am made
Of LOVE, of LOVE, of LOVE
But I'll give up for you
Of LOVE, of LOVE, of LOVE
But I'll give up for you

They meant no harm
They never do
You can take it any way you want
It comes and it goes
Rising in broken waves and dreams

The whole night long
The whole night through
Your lungs' soft heaving in slow drunken time
Falling with mine forever here

Glacier Atu Remix,pop,James Vincent McMorrow,2016,"Someone here's a lie, somewhere underneath, caught between the railing, mirroring the beat
I no longer feel and the years asleep
Show no sense of hope, staring honestly
I wanna go south of the river, glacier slow in the heart of the winter
I wanna go south of the river, facing alone in the heart of the winter
And this we'll celebrate, this we'll celebrate
There and on the stage, this is a mistake
Damn me off too long
Down the earth and moon, damn the clawing kneeling, rustling into change
In a moment I was caught, calling by a storm
In the moment of a hot
I wanna go south of the river, glacier slow in the heart of the winter
I wanna go south of the river, facing alone in the heart of the winter
I'm not in a glove called how
Few became, few became as glory as along against the forest state and starting living in the new
Harrow since, harrow since the farthest reach underneath inside a cheat
Something is alive, somewhere underneath
Caught between the real and the fake
I don't want to fit, there and has been found
Silence is so cold, and there's no sense at all
And I was someone else, I was something good
Barely in the old
There among the cold
I wanna go south of the river, glacier slow in the heart of the winter
I wanna go south of the river, facing alone in the heart of the winter",1899,117676

Maybe it's because my girlfriend is the plug

Maybe it's because the lies, they fill her up

You see the blood at her front door

Lookin' at the things that we couldn't afford
Fantasies became reality, but only for one of us

Like A Circle,pop,Ben Abraham,2021,"[Verse 1]
Make my love like a river I said thinking it would be
Covering the in-between and joining you to me
See I knew that you would wander and I thought you could be free
I guess I thought that this is what you wanted

[Chorus]
But I won't love like this again
Because it wears the heart too thin
So make my love like a circle, no beginning and no end
Give me love like a circle and I'll be happy then

[Verse 2]
Make my love like an ocean I said deep as deep can be
My might of heart enfolding you, your heart dеfining me
Is there anything so awеsome as the fury of the sea?
The violence was beauty for a moment

[Chorus]
But I won't love like this again
That changes with the southern wind
So make my love like a circle, ground on which I can depend
Give me love like a circle and I'll be happy then
[Bridge]
I seem to live in straight lines
My life is made of straight lines
Always before or behind
I can't escape the straight lines

So make my love like a circle, oh, and teach my heart to bend
Give me love like a circle and I'll be happy then",6948,44310
Intro AMA,pop,ODESZA,2017,"[Spoken: Brit Marling & (William Mapother)]
Do you know that story of the Russian cosmonaut?
So, he goes up in this big spaceship
And he's got this portal window
And he's looking out of it
And he sees the curvature of the Earth for the first time
And all of a sudden, this strange ticking
Begins coming out of the dashboard (Okay, yeah)
But he can't find it, he can't stop it, it keeps going
A few hours into this, it begins to feel like torture
What's he gonna do? He's up in space!
So the cosmonaut decides
The only way to save his sanity
Is to fall in love with this sound",38358,11099

In My Dreams,pop,Christy Altomare,2017,"[ANYA]
They said I was found by the side of a road
There were tracks all around, it had recently snowed
In the darkness and cold with the wind in the trees
A girl with no name, and no memories but these

Rain against a window, sheets upon a bed
Terrifying nurses whispering overhead
""Call the child Anya, give the child a hat""
I don't know a thing before that

Traveling the back roads, sleeping in the wood
Taking what I needed, working when I could
Keeping up my courage, foolish as it seems
At night all alone in my dreams

In my dreams shadows call
There's a light at the end of a hall
Then my dreams fade away
But I know it all will come back
One day
I dream of a city beyond all compare
Is it Paris? Paris...
A beautiful river, a bridge by a square
And I hear a voice whisper
""I'll meet you right there in Paris""
Paris...

You don't know what it's like
Not to know who you are
To have lived in the shadows
And travelled this far
I've seen flashes of fire
Heard the echo of screams
But I still have this faith
In the truth of my dreams!

In my dreams it's all real
And my heart has so much to reveal
And my dreams seem to say
""Don't be afraid to go on
Don't give up hope, come what may""
I know it all will come back
One day!",203606,2449

Find another life

What I love most about rivers is
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing
But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing
What's around the riverbend
Waiting just around the riverbend

I look once more, just around the river bend
Beyond the shore, where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for
What I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend for me
Coming for me

I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming
For a handsome sturdy husband
Who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming?
Just around the river bend
Just around the river bend
I look once more, just around the river bend
Beyond the shore, somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for
Why do all my dreams extend
Just around the river bend?
Just around the river bend

Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum?
Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, Dream Giver
Just around the river bend?",32390,12801

It pours on our skin
We're young and salt
Sticks to our clothes
Low tide nicking fins
Calling each other out
I asked, who am I, I am all yours
Spent time searching for all that comes
Not in comfort but loving you


‘Cause I’ve seen all the pretty girls and I like to believe
That you are different
You’re in a different league


Still gonna miss your heartbeat
Laying next me
And when this morning came
I didn't want you to go
I'm still gonna miss your heartbeat
I have to let you know
I can't wait for you to come back to be
Together wherеver we go
Go, go, go

They pour on our skin
Wе have high hopes
We yelling to the eve
Warm throats kicking and singing
Until our legs and our voice gives out (hey!)
Daze
Moments to remember recall
I was sitting by myself
I found pace in numbering afternoons until I was meeting you

That you are different

The most common symptoms are shortness of breath and chest pain

Our roots reach down, our branches rise
From sky to ground, our wooden eyes
Have gazed upon desires, hope, and greed

But to each soul who walks this way
A tree disclaimer we must say
We give not what you want - but what you need

For the greenery has always seen the reason and the rhyme
But we’ve had nothing but time since we’ve been seeds
And you might believe you know your truth
But truth can oft' be lies

And you might just be surprised by what you need
What you need, la-la-la-la

That David played and it pleased the Lord

It goes like this, the fourth the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
Though I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter what you heard
The holy or the broken, Hallelujah
Hallelujah...

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's no complaint you hear tonight

Your boy in green
Oh yeah, it's me Luigi
It's-a me, Luigi
My mansion was such a lonely place to be-gi
Nobody-a talk-a to me
The ghosts would throw away the key
To lock their rooms when they would see me
Walking down the hallway with my hoover
It's a hoover of friendship
My friends all laughed at me including Yoshi
The creature I literately ride on!
They laugh because I'm clumsy and I'm tall
They don't care at all!
They only care about my jump
And last year Daisy gave me the dump
Cause she secretly had a fling with Yoshi
Which I'm pretty sure is illegal
I was tired of this Mario Land
And I'm afraid I had to force my hand...
[Verse 2]
So I took them all for a mansion tour
I said ""I had an extension""
But on the second floor they fell through a trap door
To a cage I made that day
And I paid Bowser to scare my friends
To play a little prank on them
But ironically, Bowser pranked me
And started to torture my closest friends
He made a giant hamster wheel for Yoshi
That powers a giant machine
That makes his evil wooden death ship fly
If he stops running we all die!
And Peach was serving drinks to guys
Just like in that movie Return of the Jedi
There's no chance of an escape
I may have made a big mistake

[Refrain]
This is the tale of Luigi's big mistake
Oh no!
This isn't what he wanted for goodness sake!

[Verse 3]
Toad was kept deep within a dungeon
He hasn't eaten in months
As a one man factory mass producing mushrooms
His bum is extremely tired!
And Mario was smashing bricks
Whilst goombas hit him hard with sticks
There's no chance of an escape
I may have made a big mistake
(I may have made a big mistake)
[Refrain]
This is the tale of Luigi's big mistake
No-ooo-oo!
This isn't what he wanted for goodness sake!

[Verse 4]
As for me, Luigi, I'm still lonely
I may be a little more lonely than before
And the Mushroom Kingdom is destroyed
By an evil, spiky, tyrant Blastoise
The lesson that I learned that day
Is never turn your back-",5941,50025

The Big Finale,pop,UglyDolls Cast,2019,"There's a child for every doll
But I guess that’s not quite true
There won't be one for me, no
Or for you, or you, or you
I can't believe it’s over and Lou'll get his way
Even dreamers have to wake up
Guess today, we'll be the...

Show 'em who you are
Show 'em that you're strong
Show 'em that you know where you belong
Open every door on your destiny

Look down deep in your heart
And believe in the you that you see
Then become what you are
And you'll set yourself free

Soon us Uglies were hanging with our opposites
And we pretty dolls embrace all our messy bits
Though we’re not truly perfect, so what? (Woah)
We just couldn’t be better
Now the portal is permanently open wide
You can go be with your child on the other side
Then come back once the kid hits the sack (Woah)
Life just couldn't be better

Don’t sweat, don't sweat, don't worry, don't fear
Stop the press, ’cause the canine's here
But this old dog has learned a new trick
Being ugly is better than slick

See ugly is different, ugly is unique
Just keepin' it real when you feel like a freak
So face it, embrace it, follow your bless
It doesn't get better than this

Yeah, it's a mixed up life in an inside-out world
But it all couldn't be any clearer
We may be pinstriped, checkered, or polka dot swirled
But we love what we see in the mirror
And it's a nonstop blast of awesome ugliness
It's amazing, you bet, but there's something much better
So amazing and yet it gets even much better
There's one thing, there's one thing that's better",5027,56967

Brown skin, hazel eyes
1991, the start of my life
California, down to Georgia and back to Cali. again
Didn't have a ton of friends, I didn't fit in

So I learned to play an instrument and sing just how I feel

Some things really change
I know some lovely people now
But one thing still remains
That I was meant to be...

But I stand for who I am and who I'm made to be

When fads and fashion fade
One thing will remain...

Keeps you right in it, change a side a bit
Makes you care (Makes you there) There
Or at least stare

Oh a life
Stopped in pose
In a world that never goes

I'm running mid a road as I'm chased through a town, psychotic
(Good lady, good, good lady)
Mama, let me in

Much like my mother crying (cut me a piece of you)

A moment split in half

It's the final flame for what's in the frame
It's not right
It's not wrong
In its depth, its height, its color, its plight, its wonder
Its song
It's whats inside

So focus (Focus, focus)

Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons

And watched it slip away
Where are we now?
Not where we want to be

Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you

Resonance soul eater English,pop,PelleK,2008,"If the lamplight of connected souls points toward your heart
Can you hear a resonance stronger than words now?

Our eyes barely even meet, but our fates are intertwined
Our destinations are exactly the same, so run through the unbearable night alongside me

Even if the radiance that we chased too far
Continues into bad dreams

If the lamplight of connected souls points toward your heart
Can you hear a resonance stronger than words now?

I don’t care about the reason for why we met, but by the number of wounds
Of when we are entranced by and touch each other, it can become certain
Kick away the twisted world where lies and disguises exist
I want to see the end of various fascinations that seem fragile

The arm grasping me, saying, “I won’t leave you alone”
Is too far away from kindness

Because there’s no tomorrow that can promise everything
Won’t you try believing in a bond slightly better than yesterday’s?
If the lamplight of connected souls points toward your heart
Can you hear a resonance stronger than words now?
I don’t care about the reason for why we met, but by the number of wounds
Of when we are entranced by and touch each other, it can become certain",4325,63921

Poor Unfortunate Souls,pop,Original Broadway Cast of The Little Mermaid,2008,"[URSULA, spoken]
My dear, sweet child--it's what I live for: to help unfortunate merfolk like yourself
Poor souls with no one else to turn to. . 

I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
True? Yes

And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed
(Pathetic!)

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed!
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, ""Spells, Ursula, please!""
And I help them
Yes I do!

Now, it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes, I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls

[URSULA, spoken]
Here's my best offer, babykins. I know a spell that will turn you into a human for three days. Now, it's got a procedural clause, sort of a ""squid pro quo."" Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear ol' princey to kiss you. If you do, you'll stay human forever

[ARIEL, spoken]
And if I don't?

[URSULA, spoken]
Nothing drastic, darling, I'm sure. . . Oh, look--small print: ""Your soul is mine forever, and you're doomed to spend eternity in my watery, hell-soaked lair."" Lawyers! Don't you just love 'em? Of course, there is one more thing. . . my fee

[ARIEL, spoken]
But I don't have anything!
[URSULA, spoken]
I'm not askin' for much, Only. . . your voice

[ARIEL, spoken]
My voice? But if I give away my voice, how can I ever--

[URSULA]
You'll have your looks. . . your pretty face. . . and don't underestimate the power of body language!

The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore!
Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?

Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man

Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman
And I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad, but true
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
Go ahead and sign the scroll!
Flotsam, Jetsam--now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
You poor unfortunate soul!

Beluga, sevruga, come winds of the Caspian Sea. . 
Larynxes, glaucitis, ad max laryngitis, la voce to me!

Now, sing! Sing your voice over to me!

[ARIEL]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah...

[URSULA]
Sing and keep singing!

Were Leaving,pop,DeVotchKa,2004,"Raise your glasses please into a toast

On June, July, August, September
Let's drink 'em all

There's no room for lost years
So we're leaving
We're leaving tonight

Staring at a photograph of you and your best friends

To be leaving you here
But we're leaving, we're leaving
We're leaving tonight

There is something in the air, something is wrong
Where is my father, my mother, my sister, my lover?

If I Knew How to Hold You,pop,Andrew Belle,2020,"[Verse 1]
You didn’t know your own heart
Or how it might fit
I’m in the house that you grew up in, where you
Gave me it
Where your brother read books
While your sister slept in
And where we laughed over imitations on the internet

[Chorus]
How you long for me to find what you’ve been burying
How your hands are too small for what they’ve been carrying
How many words have I wrote down without saying it
If I knew how to hold you I would

[Verse 2]
You said it makes you feel small
That your heart is so big
But you just gave a piece for some kind of
Counterfeit
Now the sun has gone down
On a road that we chose
You know your words are a light, you should
Lead with those
[Chorus]
How you long for me to find what you’ve been burying
How your hands are too small for what they’ve been carrying
How many words have I wrote down without saying it
If I knew how to hold you I would

Sure deliverance
Lives through heartache
What a difference your new start made
Will you open up your windows
I could hold you now
Your deliverance
For a namesake
What a difference that a day made
Will you open all your windows
I could hold you now

Drive your problems from here

Wipe the miles away

I'll never hear you
And never do what you say

We just poked a little empty pie
For the fun that people had at night
Late at night don't need hostility
Timid smile and pause to free

I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll

Look, my eyes are just holograms
Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be

More than twist in my sobriety

Time to risk a life, a life, a life

Soft and porky

Pig out 'til you've seen the light

Read them good and well
Pretty people, nervous people
People have got to sell
News you have to sell

From my hands you know you'll never be

Side by side on rocks we feel the tide as the sea contracts and swells
Pearls grow from the pain inside we often know so well
So languageless, emotionless we must now find
Some way to tell the ocean not to worry
Ultimately all, predictably, is well

Furthermore, it seems you're sinking, do not waste time with regret
Most of the world is covered in that stuff which constitutes your sweat
With which your body's, for a long time now, been marginally wet

I would tell you but I'm not so good with words
Language makes a simple feeling seem oh so absurd
Anyway, my songs about contentment so far always end in verbs
Like ""drive"", or ""run"", or ""go to sleep, the damage has been done""
Life's not made up of things that must be lost or won
But you can live that way if that's what you call fun

Oh karma chameleon
Are you in tune to the voice that makes that noise saying your work here is done?
And do you dream at night of thoughts inside you'll never tell no one
Unless you find some way to mask them in some sarcastic pun?
And oh, misguided secret angel on the run
What was so wrong with taking your wings off, a day of working done
In your dreams of hell, do you have endless chores or are you banished to boredom?
Now you can't decide if you believe in either one
You can't decide if you believe in either one
You'll not know until you've tried, and so you can't decide
You can't decide if you believe in either one",6541,46438
Half the World Away,pop,Lewis Capaldi,2018,"[Verse 1]
She said, ""Go find a little more heart
A little more soul and let me know
When you feel that fire get a little less cold
Just let me know""

I burned my bones getting closer than I've been before
I found myself diving headfirst through a closing door
I fall in love but I can't find a way to make it stay
It's always half the world away

She said, ""Stay, why'd you always have to walk away""
Girl, you know I've always been the same
I'm a runaway
And I've never been sure
If I'll ever want more
I'm a runaway

[Chorus]
I burned my bones getting closer than I've been before
I found myself diving headfirst through a closing door
I fall in love but I can't find a way to make it stay

I lost all hope in the road that we were walking on
I fall in love but I can't find a way to make it stay
It's always half the world away

Left there in your heart

In the Pines,pop,Dave Van Ronk,1991,"Little girl, little girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines
I shivered the whole night through
My daddy was a railroad man
Killed a mile and a half from here
His head was found in a drivers wheel
His body hasn't never been found
In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines
Well shivered the whole night through
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to moan
You've caused me to lose my home
The last words that you'll hear me say
Was I want you to sing me a song
In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines
Well shiver the whole night through
Little girl, little girl, where'd you sleep last night
Not even your mother knows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines
Shivered where the cold winds blow",2144,107742

Not everyone is as lucky as me

She'll grow up to be like you
If she sometimes takes after her father

Grow our own food, get a couple of sheep
Or a place in maybe New York City

There's no fear in my eyes

Reign Jesus reign
Kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of the risen Son

The whole earth is filled with Your glory
The heavens declaring Your praise

Magna Carta 800 Years,pop,Horrible Histories,2015,"[Barons]
Here's the story
Of a very old decree
Forced on King John as he made off
With the revenue
Of us barons
And the aristocracy
He took our land and for a lark
Held our sons hostage too

Magna Carta (Magna Carta?)
Told King John he's gotta be
He's gotta be subject to law
Agree tax with us too
Gave his seal (Gave my seal?)
Then withdrew his guarantee
Left to Henry Third
And Edward First to pass it through

And I would say 800 years
A birthday worth 800 cheers
Since 1215 Magna Carta's been
A foundation of our democracy
[Peasants]
By 1500
It reads as all men are free
Even peasants just like me
Can tell kings that it's true
For years it vanished
Until Edward Coke MP (That's me!)
Challenged Charles I
As his own powers grew

You'd think that Cromwell (Jolly Olly)
Would agree, but instead he said

[Oliver Cromwell]
Magna Carta? Magna Farta, more like
Not for me!

[Thomas Jefferson]
I'm Thomas Jefferson
And Edward Coke is the bees' knees
Our American Constitution
Incorporated his decrees

[All]
And I believe 800 years
Has proved from ancient pioneers
Best British invention of all
Apart, of course, from soccerball
Magna Carta (Super Charter)
Magna Carta (It's a part'a)
What you're taught at school
Magna Carta (Just for starter)
Magna Carta (Nothing smarter)
Kings, watch how you rule

Eleanor Roosevelt extended
This letter to America

[Eleanor Roosevelt]
Here's a story
Of a very old decree
And now enshrined in UN
Human rights since World War II
It began as
Help for the aristocracy
Now it's for you and me
And everyone in the world too

[All]
And I would hope 800 years
Of freedom never disappears
All hail this simple ancient law
May it survive 800 more

Song of Durin,pop,Eurielle,2014,"A king he was on carven throne
In many-pillared halls of stone
With golden roof and silver floor
And runes of power upon the door
The light of sun and star and moon
In shining lamps of crystal hewn
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night
There shone for ever fair and bright

The world is grey, the mountains old
The forge's fire is ashen-cold
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls
The darkness dwells in Durin's halls
The shadow lies upon his tomb
In Moria, in Khazad-dûm
But still the sunken stars appear
In dark and windless Mirrormere
There lies his crown in water deep
Till Durin wakes again from sleep",9782,33803

In actuality this is just more personality
But just in case we haven't met, please accept my formality

Vian or Vyan, there’s no need for clarifyin'
Regardless my identity, I'll still be there supplyin'
Originality will always keep me qualifyin'
Quality flying, nothing but satisfyin'
But hey I'm humble in nature yet I know who I be
Not to spill tea, apologizes if I seem cocky
So pardon me, if you see me as a little too drastic
Pleasure to meet cha, the name is Viantastic

Tunnel vision, on a path of perfection
Reenactment, a complimenting distraction
Creating traction, momentum building a faction
Satisfaction by simple law of attraction
And interaction with undeniable passion
Actions in the making history everlastin'
Over-thusiastic, A little sarcastic
Here’s the facts kid, nothing short of fantastic
On a mission, to create a rendition
Submission to my illusions coming to a fruition
In addition to the vision of my minds intuition
Further from a decision than an unhealthy addiction
Ambition, my ignition to commission transmission
My disposition now conditioned to transition to musician
And despite competition, I’ll dispel superstition
See past all opposition to my own guiding decision

Regardless my identity, I'll still be there supplyin'

So pardon me, if you see me as a little too drastic
Pleasure to meet cha, the name is Viantastic

Started seeing fame in squid game
Can't aim but despite my shame, became a known name
I don't claim to have skill, that's simply insane
Just the same, if lame, I'll edit out of frame
I could train, but who cares, simply here to entertain
Bad puns are my subs and comedy is my main
A grain of maturity no need to complain
Restrained in profanity will keep you guessing in your brain
No need to clickbait it's fate I captivate
Look mate, at this rate, you'll forget Agent 8
No need to hesitate, relax let me navigate
Your state into whatever great that I create
Popping up in related, virality hated
Nothing but motivated for my fans, obligated
Calculated insanity, fuelling creativity
Persistent productivity, just try and avoid me",3520,74611

The songbird leaves the nest
With a dream and a heavy chest
Writing winded words to the clouds out west
Is it for the best
Who knows if it was the right thing
Maybe I’m crazy in advance
Leaving my love in the arms of chance
Keep in mind I will never be anyone else’s trusted or lusted hand

This isn’t the end my darling, little star

When LA chews me up and spits me back out into the sky
I know I’ll land next to you, in Carolina

Dear Jesus, I know that I have been a stranger as of late
But I come know in seek of your grace

That I need to believe in your name
Won’t you keep her protected
Keep her well inside the lines
And warm in troubled times
And if she meets someone new
May he be the best man you've ever designed

Like I can never tell

Or if you meant it well

It wakes the sleepless every night

When I want to stay you get hung up
And when I walk away you're in love
You're in love

Tell me I'm the only one
And tell me everything you want
It takes a lot of guts to say
I don't want to play
It won't hurt this way
I don't believe it that you're sinking and I'm okay

Think of something interesting

You're so far from the start
Relax your face and say the password

Let’s Have Another Cup of Coffee,pop,Irving Berlin,1988,"[Verse:]
Why worry when skies are gray
Why should we complain
Let's laugh at the cloudy day
Let's sing in the rain
Songwriters say the storm quickly passes
That's their philosophy
They see the world through rose-colored glasses
Why shouldn't we?

[Refrain:]
Just around the corner
There's a rainbow in the sky
So let's have another cup o' coffee
And let's have another piece o' pie!

Trouble's just a bubble
And the clouds will soon roll by
So let's have another cup o' coffee
And let's have another piece o' pie
Let a smile be your umbrella
For it's just an April show'r
Even John D. Rockefeller
Is looking for the silver lining

Mister Herbert Hoover
Says that now's the time to buy
So let's have another cup o' coffee
And let's have another piece o' pie!

It dishonors those who go before us

There is sorrow in my town
There is panic in the nation
There is wailing the whole world round
May the children see more clearly
May the elders be more wise
May the winds of change caress us

Give me a desert to hold my fears
Give me a sunset to hold my wonder

When your friends came to dinner and they stayed the night
And then they cleaned out the refrigerator
They ate everything in sight
And then they stayed up in the living room
And they cried all night

Strange angels singing just for me
Old stories, they're haunting me
This is nothing like I thought it would be

Well I was out in my four door with the top down
And I looked up and there they were
Millions of tiny teardrops just sort of hanging there
And I didn't know whether to laugh or cry
And I said to myself: What next big sky?
Strange angels singing just for me
Their spare change falls on top of me
Rain falling, falling all over me

EPIK HIGH - 문배동 단골집 Munbae-dong English Translation,pop,Genius English Translations,2017,"[Verse 1: Tablo]
Been a few years but can’t forget
Our favourite place, that saw our beginning and end
Remembered it a few days ago all of a sudden
But when I went to visit, it was gone
Standing there was a phone store instead, as if it’s been there the whole time
In the corner where our names would be carved into the wall, an LED screen flashed ads instead

[Verse 2: Tablo]
How funny - there was once a time where my call history was filled up with your name
And not long ago, I dropped my phone while fidgeting and thinking about you
So it was about time I changed phones, then I happened to come across this store
Not sure if time is running fast or I’m running slow, but I’m finding it hard to catch up
The world keeps changing, and it’s hard to find someone who wouldn’t change

[Refrain: Crush]
Where to, where to?
To the place you and I were staying
Cuz I wanna go back
Man, things done changed
At the place where I would hear Kim Gun-mo, Taiji Boys, and Exhibition
All I hear now is TRAP
Man, things done changed

[Verse 3: Mithra Jin]
My dream was my everything around my twenties
My wallet would always be full of sighs and worries
On nights where I craved a drink
I’d find solace in the bar in the bygone days of youth
Kept thinking of it today of all days, so turned my car around
I’ve forgotten for so long
For years. Time does fly
I’m nearly there, holding my breath already
It would be right around the corner of that building

[Verse 4: Mithra Jin]
Trees lining the street, a few empty benches
Lovers exchanging whispers and the neatly organized footpath
There stood a scene - only unknown to me - stepping on my memories
As nothing lasts forever, I, too, would slowly collect dust on the far side of time that heartlessly passes by
I’d be remembered, right?

[Refrain #2: Crush]
Here or there?
Where does my path lie?
Cuz I wanna go back
Man, things done changed
At the place where
I would hear Epik High on rainy days
All I hear now is TRAP
Man, things done changed

[Bridge: Crush]
Though nothing lasts forever
I’ll wave to you across the river of time
Some things don’t change

Though nothing lasts forever
I’ll wait, across the wall of time
Some things don’t change
If you call my name again

I’ll (time flies) come back

If you had a heart, oh, I'm sure it would break
'Cause loving you's getting harder to fake
Harder to fake, yeah

You're so mean, I keep my words behind my teeth
But I let you know I hate you when you fall asleep
And now you know
Everything I dealt with to keep them close
Bleeding out the hands just for you to fold
But you never showed, so I let it go

And if you wanna lose it
Then, baby, that's on you
Not me no more

Seem to vanish like a gamblers lucky streak

And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I love to go out fishing
In a river, or a creek

As Time Goes By from Casablanca,pop,Dooley Wilson,2015,"You must remember this
A kiss is just a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you.""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman need man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman need man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory

Stalin Wasnt Stallin,pop,Robert Wyatt,1982,"Stalin wasn't stallin'
When he told the beast of Berlin
That they'd never rest contented
Till they had driven him from the land
So he called the Yanks and English
And proceeded to extinguish
The Führer and its vermin
This is how it all began

Now, the Devil, he was reading
In the Good Book one day
How that Lord created Adam
To walk the righteous way
And it made the Devil jealous
He turned green up to his horns
And he swore by things unholy
And he made one of his own

So he packed two suitcases
Full of grief and misery
And he caught the Midnight Special
Going down to Germany
Then he mixed his lies and hatred
With fire and brimstone
Then the Devil sat upon it
That's how Adolf was born
Now Adolf got the notion
That he was the master race
And he swore he'd bring New Order
And put mankind in its place!
So he set a scheme in motion
And was winning everywhere
Until he upped and got the notion
For to kick that Russian bear

Stalin wasn't stallin'
When he told the Beast of Berlin
That they'd never rest contented
Till they had driven him from the land
So he called the Yanks and English
And proceeded to extinguish
The Führer and its vermin
This is how it all began

Yes he kicked that noble Russian
But it wasn't very long
Before Adolf got suspicious
That he had done something wrong
'Cause that bear grabbed the Führer
And gave him an awful fright
Seventeen months he scrapped the Führer
Tooth and claw, day and night
Then that bear smacked the Führer
With a mighty armored paw
And Adolf broke all records
Running backwards to Krakaw
Then Goebbels sent a message
To the people everywhere
That if they couldn't hit the Führer
Go down hit that Russian bear

Stalin wasn't stallin'
When he told the Beast of Berlin
That they'd never rest contented
Till they had driven him from the land
So he called the Yanks and English
And proceeded to extinguish
The Führer and its vermin
This is how it all began

Then this bear called on his buddy
The noble fighting Yank
And they sent the Führer running
With their ships and planes and tanks
Now the Führer's having nightmares
Cause the Führer knows darn well
That the Devil's done wrote ""Welcome""
On his residence in Hell",3618,73039

A Fine Romance,pop,Ella Fitzgerald,1963,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance
A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We two should be like clams in a dish of chowder
But we just fizz like parts of a Seidlitz powder

A fine romance, with no pinches
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France!

There on the side of the street
Concrete casualties of love

Raise high then dropped down
And now I don't know what's left of me

But I'll collect myself and crawl through the shadows
Reach up my hands to the sky and shout out
I'll never make these same mistakes again
Cause someone up there holds the key to my heart
I'd do everything to tear it apart
By never allowing myself to let you in

When all I want is for you to see
The side that I don't show to anyone in fear that they may turn and run
Alone and incomplete
No more tears to cry and no more blood to bleed

I'll fall forever endlessly
When you should be the ground beneath my feet

Spare me the shock in looking at yourselves
It scares me there’s shock I could love myself
How I do

It’s always been bigger than this
And I fucking swear I swear down
That we love ourselves politically
It’s rebellious
Are you sitting comfortable
While we bleed in vain
I’ve died by other names

Please make me feel you care my ally
But are you prepared to
To lose your sleep
To bare your teeth
To break like me

Cry in the bathroom
But they’ll never have you
It’s always been bigger than this
And I fucking swear I swear down

Beeswing,pop,Christy Moore,2005,"I was 18 when I came to town they called it the summer of love
Burning babies burning flags the hawks against the doves
I took a job at the steaming way down on Caltrim St
Fell in love with a laundry girl that was workin next to me

Brown hair zig zagged across her face and a look of half surprise
Like a fox caught in the headlights there was animal in her eyes
She said to me can’t you see I’m not the factory kind
If you don’t take me out of here I’ll surely lose my mind

She was a rare thing fine as a bee’s wing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child, she was runnin’ wild (she said)
So long as theres no price on love I’ll stay
You wouldn’t want me any other way

We busked around the market towns fruit pickin down in kent
We could tinker pots and pans or knives wherever we went
We were campin down the Gower one time, the work was mighty good
She wouldn’t wait for the harvest, I thought we should
I said to her we’ll settle down, get a few acres dug
A fire burning in the hearth and babbies on the rug
She said Oh man you foolish man that surely sounds like hell
You might be lord of half the world,You’ll not own me as well

She was a rare thing fine as a bee’s wing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child, she was runnin’ wild (she said)
So long as theres no price on love I’ll stay
You wouldn’t want me any other way

We were drinking more in those days our tempers reached a pitch
Like a fool I let her run away when she took the rambling itch
Last I heard she was living rough back on the Derby beat
A bottle of White Horse in her pocket, a Wolfhound at her feet

They say that she got married once to a man called Romany Brown
Even a gypsy caravan was too much like settlin’ down
They say her rose has faded, rough weather and hard booze
Maybe thats the price you pay for the chains that you refuse

She was a rare thing, fine as a bee’s wing
I miss her more than ever words can say
If I could just taste all of her wildness now
If I could hold her in my arms today
I wouldn’t want her any other way",23761,16579

Do I make you nervous when I look in your eye?
Don't you look away when I ask you why
Why you ask me to stay when you wanna go
Dancing with other ladies, while I'm here at home? Yeah

Was it something that I done?
Am I being dumb? I did nothing wrong

Benefit of the doubt
Too many to count
Moving forward now

Nothing more to say
Gotta hope and pray

Rain,pop,Sarah Geronimo,2018,"Rain gently falls whenever
We say goodnight
Falling like when your out of sight
Rain follows me even in my bed
And rain is the tears that I shed

There'll be no sunshine in my life
Until you say your mine oh mine
There'll be no summer, spring or fall
Each day is like winter time
But I can never say I care
I know it won't be smart
Somebody owns your heart
It can never be mine

So it rains when your near
Knowing we can't even touch
Rain knows that I love you so much
But I know that my love
Will only cause you pain
So I'd rather live with the rain
There'll be no sunshine in my life
Until you say your mine oh mine
There'll be no summer, spring or fall
Each day is like winter time
But I can never say I care
I know it won't be smart
Somebody owns your heart
It can never be mine

Rain gently falls whenever
We say goodnight
Falling like when your out of sight
Rain follows me even in my bed
And rain is the tears that I shed

There'll be no sunshine in my life

I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone and so was I
So I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

[Chorus]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, ""I don't,"" she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never would've thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

Alright

Froukje - Ik Wil Dansen English Translation,pop,Genius English Translations,2020,"[Refrain]
I want to go dancing
I’ve got nothing on this entire Tuesday night
A while ago, I was still crying
But I’m changing
I’m going clockwise, I’m alone again
I’m throwing my chances right away
But I want to go dancing now
I want to cry in the rain without using an umbrella
So no one will suspect me of not being well

[Verse 1]
It looks to be turning over when I’m dancing in the club because
Everyone you dance with will forget you
And I can go cold blood with my tears and my sweat
I can drown in my anger, nobody knows my name here
My loss completes me
Because if I were too happy
I would’ve been empty, my life would be leveled
I’ve got to cry to be writing, I’ve got to hide to stay
Tonight, I’ve got to dance
Tonight, I’ve got to dance
[Chorus]
I’m afraid of a new day
So I dance until the pain fades
And I know he’s waiting for me
Because the truth it harsh, but the night is soft
What if I stay here forever?
The club merges with the sweat on my body
I can’t redo my life
Tonight, I’ve got to dance
Tonight, I’ve got to dance

[Verse 2]
It’s getting late now
I see an idiot in the mirror and I hate her
There’s something that doesn’t want to talk
But that’s over, it’s done
And if I don’t dance with time, she’ll dance with me and
I’ve got to be moving
Yes, I fill an emptiness when I’m dancing in the club
And for a while they’ve been keeping silent
But I come across the voices in my head
I’ve got sweat in my hands and an aching head
But music has been numbing me since 2001
And I can feel my feet, they’re taking me away
And before I know it, it’s a quarter past two
[Bridge]
I’ve got to dance
Breathe in, breathe out
Don’t breathe, that will interrupt the noise
Don’t breathe, they’ll hear
That there’s something alive they can disturb

[Chorus]
I’m afraid of a new day
So I dance until the pain fades
And I know he’s waiting for me
Because the truth it harsh, but the night is soft
What if I stay here forever?
The club merges with the sweat on my body
I can’t resit my life
Tonight, I’ve got to dance
Tonight, I’ve got to dance

So how do I make you see?

I keep on hearing voices
They're questioning my choices
I lay awake, I can't sleep, no
(hearing voices)
The cycles I try to break them
But I just can't seem to shake them
Guess I'm stuck in this routine
When I hear the voices say
You're not good enough
You should give up
You'll never find love
When I hear the voices
I hear the voices say
I still hold on to hope so hopelessly
But don't see the love surrounding me
There's a light on the hill I try to reach
But every time the climbs too steep

And his voice like the thunder
Keeps me falling under
I'm not who I wish to be
Now I just wanna break down
But I won't say it out loud
So how do I make you see?

I keep on hearing voices

I hear the voices say
Happy child just stay the same as you are
Happy child don't change
Happy child teach us to smile through the dark
Happy child don't change like me
Cause I keep on hearing...

I keep on hearing voices

In My Dreams,pop,CaRter,2017,"[Verse 1]
All these lies are taking a toll on me
You still believe everything is meant to be
But this is slowing down, so we throw away the dream
Gotta let go somehow just to be free
I've been a mess by myself
Seems like there's nobody else
But our time was up
I feel the rain falling down
My world seems so different now
But I don't wanna do another run around with you

[Chorus]
So I'll still see you
In my dreams tonight
Thinking of the memories
That we made for life
And everything that we did so wrong
I'll be thinking 'bout until the morning comes
Yeah so I'll still see you
In my dreams tonight

All my sins are coming right back to me
I'm not the only one to believe in destiny
We grew apart and we threw away the key
You gotta let it go just to be free
Maybe we weren't just enough
I tried to give you my love
But you turned away
I still feel rain coming down
How come you're so different now
And I don't even recognize you anymore

So I'll still see you

That we made for life
And everything that we did so wrong

And all I'm tryna be
This is the part where I spit it all out
And you decide what you think of me

But I've been handing out benefits of the doubt
And I'd like a little bit back

And if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest things
It's just my little voice that I've been missing

They can cut both ways
No amount of remembering the better things will make the bad ones go away

She bruised her pomegranet

There should be no doubts

Get the hell out of this town
So we can get a better feel for each other

Remembered how you used to
Just live your life a little for me

Step away and watch me grow

Bulbel,pop,Mili (Indie),2021,"[Intro]
I’m lost in your world
Looking for a purpose that belongs to me only
May the lilies bloom for me

[Verse 1]
Do you hear the lilies speak?
The leaves kissing the bees
The soil covering up all the sorrow
All the seeds I sowed
In a garden can’t be claimed by me
Do you hear the lilies speak?

[Chorus]
I gave it my all
Isn’t it supposed to be sunny now?
But my rain won’t stop
My rain won’t stop
The hell I saw, voices I heard
The dreams that I lost changed nothing at all
I’m still my insufferable self
Setting my hair on fire, giving you warmth
Hoping you’d rеalize
I want you by my side
May the liliеs bloom for me
[Verse 2]
Thought I would be satisfied
Seeing you content at the other side
But somehow I thought these crazy thoughts
That I deserve to be loved
I deserve to know love
We deserve to live in love
I wish there’s no end
I wish there’s no end
To our time together

[Chorus]
The lilies wilted
Waving down into my coffin
Goodbye, my youth expensed
Goodbye, my innocence
Should I be mad?
Should I be glad?
Am I enough?
How can I be enough so I'm proud of myself?
Reaching my goals
Distracting my feelings changed nothing at all
I’m still my insatiable self
Isn’t it better to be dumb?
To be ignorant?
Not knowing there is liberty
In this world not meant for me
May the lilies bloom for me",3355,77309

Friday night I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head
Looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool
To open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule

[Verse 2]
Saturday I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream
Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

If you want it
Come and get it
For crying out loud

Giving you was

Let go your head

Shining , Sky is fading red to blue
I'm kicking through the Autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to
Turning back for home
You know I'm feeling so alone
I can't believe
Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me

Come and get it

Lay my head where the embers burn
Saw a sun touch down at the edge, at the edge
Should have stayed in the line to wait my turn
But the devil he was hanging around

Growing older on the same damn streets
Pace my paces on to the same beat
Gotta be some place that I can breathe
The air freezes my lungs

If I had got right
I could have been there, could have been special

No sleep no way you can't stay
I wanted to be where the trees don't grow
Drove the morning further than the roads go
Cut my ties and left my soul
Cause the devil he be dragging me down
Laid right down that brand new place
Miles and miles behind the cooler plains
They Keep my eye on the window pane
Cause the devil he'll be hunting me down

Oh I believe man I had potential
If I had got right
I could have been there, could have been special

They infected me with high fevers and hope, oh yeah

What if the odd balls are dropping just for one fling?
What if the second verse, it doesn't even mean a thing?
What if their politics was just an idea of fun?
I'd be scared, as one should, but I'd still feel so good
What if the first born, it didn't even have a name?
What if the obvious is suddenly so insane?
What if they found how to blossom even more shame?

I know that you know that I know you're all I need

And just when I thought
It couldn't get any better
There you go and do it all again
Hope this feeling never ends

'Cause you
You make me happy
You
You make me happy

It's the sound of your voice at the end of the phone line
A tickle in my toes, just to know that you're all mine
Like an ice cream sundae with a cherry on the top
It's the look in your eyes when I'm wearing your t-shirt
Your cute little smile after a long day of hard work
And I know that you know that I can't give you up

And just when I thought
It couldn't get any better

Gosh, it disturbs me to see you Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston!
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're everyone's favorite guy
Everyone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard to see why

No one's slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston
For there's no man in town half as manly

[BIMBETTES]
Perfect, a pure paragon!

[LEFOU/MEN]
You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team they'd prefer to be on
Who plays darts like Gaston?
Who breaks hearts like Gaston?
Who’s much more than the sum of his parts like Gaston?

As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating!

My, what a guy, that Gaston!

I needed encouragement
Thank you, LeFou

Well, there's no one as easy to bolster as you!
Too much?

No one fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston

In a wrestling match, nobody bites like Gaston

And beasts of the field say a prayer
First, I carefully aim for the liver
Then I shoot from behind

Is that fair?

I don't care

No one hits like Gaston
Matches wits like Gaston

Every morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown, I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size of a barge!

Entertains like Gaston?

Who can make up these endless refrains like Gaston?
I use antlers in all of my decorating

Who's a man among men?
Who's the super success?
Don't you know? Can't you guess?
Ask his fans and his five hangers-on
There's just one guy in town
Who's got all of it down...

[Will Smith - Fresh Prince of Bel Air]
In west Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said you movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air
[Disturbed - Voices]
I can hear the voice
But I don't wanna listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright

To be one with the voice
And make everything go

But I don't wanna listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright
I can feel the subliminal need
To be one with the voice
And make everything alright

I wanna fall through the stars
Getting lost in the dark is my favorite part

We got the pynk

Pynk, like the lips around your... maybe
Pynk, like the skin that's under... baby
Pynk, where it's deepest inside... crazy
Pynk beyond forest and thighs
Pynk, like the secrets you hide... maybe
Pynk, like the lid of your eye... baby
Pynk is where all of it starts... crazy
Pynk, like the holes of your heart

I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna paint the town
I don't wanna hide my love
I just wanna hold your hand and be the one that you think of
When you need a holiday, when you wanna drink rosé
I just wanna paint your toes and in the morning kiss your nose
'Cause when I'm with you I don't feel afraid
Maybe this love will indoctrinate
I echo every word that you say
The way you feel, yeah I feel the same way
Remember the night when I combed your hair
I hope I didn't freak you out when I stared
I donate my truth to you like I'm rich
The truth is love ain't got no off switch
So if the walls come tumbling down
And if the ocean really does drown
And if my memories never come back
I'll still remember when we were first was naked at
Picture our faces and new oasis
When we made love we left many traces
Just like the blush thats on your cheeks
Deep inside we're all just Pynk

[Outro: Janelle Monáe]
Pynk, like the inside of your... baby (we're all just pink)
Pynk, like the walls and the doors... maybe (deep inside, we're all just pynk)
Pynk, like your fingers in my... maybe
Pynk is the truth you can't hide
Pynk, like your tongue going round... baby
Pynk, like the sun going down... maybe
Pynk, like the holes in your heart... baby
Pynk is my favorite part",295557,1645

Fields of green beyond your reach

You know shortly after we were married, we took a drive from Germany, where we were living, to Paris. He wanted me to meet an army buddy of his. We had a beautiful drive.​

And then, just outside of Paris, he just went crazy—just started screaming at me. ""Why couldn't I read a simple fucking map?"" I was ""a stupid worthless bitch.""

I was dumbfounded. I was terrified. It came out of nowhere, as far as I knew... Of course, I learned later that this man had been your father's lover.​

Hey hold on carnalito. Let me tell you a true story that might change your mind about being in a gang

I remember when we were just a couple of mocosos
Causing trouble all the time and getting caught with the babosos
But it was fun and we had so many good times
Me n you we put our troubles behind
It was the two of us kickin it day n night
Looking forward to the chance that we would get in a fight
Toe to toe straight boxing, putazos cada dia
Then we met up with some vatos that belonged to a pandilla
They hit us up. Were you from? I said no where man
They replied real quick. Ese get jumped into our gang
Nosotros controlamos aqui chavalas
We heard that you were tough but sebes que? We call the ballas
I looked at my carnal, my homie, my dawg
Before I had a chance the gangsters hit'em with a love
Ran up to homeboy n I gave em a putazo
Busted em in the grill but tovia no hiso caso
They jumped me from behind, I tried to hold my ground
Before I knew it man my pinche body went down
In a daze de verded no me recuerdo
All I could remember was my homie sufrieundo
It only lasted about a minute or two
But to me it seemed like it would never be through
After they rushed us they came and shook our vaizas
Now they respect us before they despised us
We're in a gang now, pues nimodo
Me n my homie beame two damn cholos
I remember you homie, I remember you homie
Ese I remember you like if it was yester day

Pistiando por la primera vez

I felt firme. Nada me vale
I'm with my homeboy listo pal desmadre
A la brava I felt like doing a jale
I asked around but everybody said chale
But you know what, here comes mi perro
He said I got your back holmes, tu sabes te quiero
So we went off in la primera mission
After our mission we felt all chingon
So we got some yezca and went up to mojale
Dropped on the oldies and kicked it loud
He liked to play brenton woods gratest hits
His favorite song was ""Baby you Got it""
When he would sing it would echo trough the cannon
It used to seem that like this place was his companion
Again I can hear it now
That foo used to sing it loud
The precious memory man, cause that's all I have
Sometimes I kick it and just think n laugh
Sometimes I kick it n just she'd a tear
""I LOVE YOU HOMIE, I MISS YOU""
I wish you were here
I remember you homie, I remember you homie
Ese I remember you like if it was yester day

I picked em up and headed to the, spot
On the way over their I told em what I thought
He said, Ey carnal no te procupes brother
Nothing could happen cause we're down with each other

Holdin em tight because I was trying, to keep em alive
So the lord wouldn't take em
His heart stopped beating so I started to shake em

Now, I'll send you my loving thoughts
Hey, will you notice them?
I almost can't help myself
My love for you
Goes deep to the bottom of my heart

I almost can't breath
That's how strong it is
You become the only one in my eyes

I'm in love",2258,103584
Extreme Wealth and Casual Cruelty,pop,Unknown Mortal Orchestra,2015,"[Verse 1]
A ghost by any other name
She’s just a frozen satellite
She’ll close her mouth and kiss with her eyes
A rose just goes insane
She spoke soft prose in Catalan
But goes further south when she speaks her mind

[Chorus]
If we were just strangers, then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty

[Verse 2]
A ghost that creeps around
A crystal surface underground
A light shows flowers crushed inside
At most the blooms get high
And stay there frozen underground
But she’s a ghost that smell like a rose
[Chorus]
If we were just strangers, then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty

[Chorus]
If we were just strangers, then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me

If we were just strangers, then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me

'cause i just throw my heart away, too shy to say hello
And i adore you from afar like an angel in the night
My heart has some battle scars but ill be alright
And sometimes i walk when i want to run

Leave me to the night and in the morning ill be alright
'cause I've got my hands and ill be holding on oh so tight
Leave me to the sun and when the clouds come ill be done
Oh ill be done
Oh ill be done

I just want to feel high today forget about myself
Put my clothes on and fly away go to someplace else
My mind takes me to places that my legs could never go
My poor heart it races every time that its exposed

And sometimes i walk when i want to run
I can't seem to talk or get anything done

Leave me to the night and in the morning ill be alright
'cause I've got my hands and ill be holding on oh so tight
Leave me to the sun and when the clouds come ill be done
Oh ill be done
Oh ill be done
Im gonna find out what it means
Oh to dream a dream
Feels like I'm bursting at the seems
Oh dream

And leave me to the night and in the morning ill be alright won't you leave me to the night and in the morning ill be alright

Woo-wee!
Woo!

First and foremost
Oh, let it be said, my dear
I was gonna wait for you
So this is not an act of spite
It's a visceral coming-to
She wrote an album
And that’s something that I can't do
But what I can do is spit the truth
And it all leads back to you

[Verse 2: Wilbur Soot]
Secondly, I know I haven't written much
You know the way I can be
Tonight, I'm fucking drunk
So it's all gonna be about me
Take a seat, pull up a chair
Give me one beat to fill my glass
I've lost a piece of me in you
But you've lost all your past

Is he better than me?
Has he seen more to this life?
Can he smoke more? Can he fuck more?
Are you good enough to be his wife?
Can he break me? Can he break you?

Yes, I don't know what I'll fuckin' do

[Verse 3: Wilbur Soot]
I've seen our café, I've clocked our plans
Oh, what could have been
If you didn’t go and fall in love
And ruin everything
I've seen him, I've been him
I've felt the same way
But now I break against the dirt
Along with our cafés

Is he better than me?
Has he seen more to this life?
Can he smoke more? Can he fuck more?
Are you good enough to be his wife?
Can he break me? Can he break you?

Yes, I don't know what I'll fuckin' do

I've lost all meaning
I've lost my sense of hope
I've seen him going out with you
I've seen what he can do

Stamina and grace

Living life in the living room

And all the places I gotta play
All the things that I gotta be at

A wonderful dream, Papa
All about June in the Orpheum circuit
Gimme a chance and I know I can work it

I had a dream
Just as real as can be, Papa

And he was saying to me:
""Rose!
Get yourself some new orchestrations
New routines and red velvet curtains
Get a feathered hat for the baby;
Photographs in front of the theatre
Get an agent and in jig time
You'll be being booked in the big time.""

They say that true love is so hard to find
I thank the man up above
For making you mine
Talking on the telephone sending you kisses
A dozen of roses just to say that I am missing
The warmth of your body right next to mine
Eres tu la mejor like a toast of fine wine
Out to the movies maybe sharing some ice cream
Si estoy dormido, don`t wake me from my dream
Todo lo que quiero, all I need is your affection
My life was fine, but you brought perfection
Now we sit here just holding hands
Whispers in my ear tell me that I`ll be your man
Today, manana, in a paradise for two
I feel the same way cuz I`m so in love with you
I love the way you make me feel
My love for you is oh so real
Embrace my body, touch me soflty
Love me `till the morning

So actually
Why do I have to hide my own feelings?
What good is love when
I can't just be myself?
And if you see what I'm really hiding
What will you say when
You find the girl inside
...
Does my heart
Only want you to love
The faker version of me?
Is it love if the girl that you
Love will never be truly free?
...
Wonder now if it's even worth trying
How can I change who I am in reality
If I can't be the girl that you wanted
What do I do in my own reality?
And in my reality
If I don't know how to love you~
I'll leave you be",8559,37593

If I lost it all today, would you stay?
Could my love be enough to stimulate?
If shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up and eventually laugh?
Roll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa

Fernando,pop,Cher,2018,"[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums, and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar...

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry...

[Chorus 1]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando...
[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus 2]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando...

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

On the other side of love
Teenage story in its glory
God, it's never quite enough

Quiet restraint takes such accomplishment

Quiet restraint takes all the best in me

And you can tell them you're the girl
Who sold her magic for the world
One day, babe, you'll be mine
And I'll be hers and we'll be fine
And I will turn those screams to rhymes
And I'll be cashing in each time

HEIZE - We Don’t Talk Together ft. GIRIBOY English Translation,pop,Genius English Translations,2019,"[Verse 1: HEIZE]
Do you feel how I do now?
It’s weird, us two together
Walking for a long while tonight
Even if it’s awkward
I’m still yours
I’m sorry, was I too cold-hearted?
Without any fear
I don’t know, I don’t know
Maybe back then
I just relied too much on
Believing you would comfort me
You’re all that’s gone
But everything is collapsing
Maybe I built my house
With this blank expression
My footsteps grow heavier
And I can’t walk

[Pre-Chorus: HEIZE]
I can’t send you out like this
But I can’t open my mouth
[Chorus: HEIZE]
I know
We love each other
We don’t talk together
I’m always yours
Why don’t you?
I don’t want to admit it
Why don’t you?
I can’t send you away

[Verse 2: GIRIBOY]
We love too much
No, I loved too much
I misunderstood the reality
Time is appraching
I have to send you away
Turn right, turn left
Go straight, 4 minutes left
I’m going to lose my mind
Breaking up hurts too much, but
I’m gonna let you go
No, I don’t want to let you go
Can’t we just heal what’s hurt?
We’ll get better
The cafe we used to go to
Is less than a minute, if I turn here
Your house, turn right
Turn left, arrive

I know
We love each other
We don’t talk together
I’m always yours
Why don’t you?
I don’t want to admit it
Why don’t you?
I can’t send you away

You turned and said “How have you been?”
We have to find our love again

We have to stop this breakup

Everywhere I go
Something strange is happening
To everyone I know

Hear the voice of loneliness
Crying in the night
See the madness in their eyes
Dancing with delight

I want to know
Why everyone I know
Has gone flip city
You say it ain't true
What can I do, now
I'm going flip city

Feels like someone's watching
Every move I make
Feels like someone's following
Every step I take
Suddenly, we're not alone
You can feel it too
Suddenly, we're not ourselves
What's come over you

I want to know
Why everyone I know
Has gone flip city
She used to want me
How can it be, now
She's gone flip city
You say it ain't true
What can I do, now
I'm going flip city
I want to know
Why everyone I know
Has gone flip city

Wake me when it's over
Tell me I'm alright
Tell me it was just a dream
Dream I had last night

I can hear the spirits now
Moving under ground
I can feel them closing in
About to drag me down
I want to know
Why everyone I know
Has gone flip city

How can it be, now

Uber's running hella late, that's two stars
Got a session in North Hollywood, that's too far
This day's not off to a good start
Phone's blowing up like hot air balloon
It's like my friends really don't think I got shit to do
Got a album on the way, I'm a busy dude
Now I know why CEO's drinking at noon

Damn, now my time's stolen

Afternoon and I'm feeling zombie
Swear I'm moving too slow, I'm too sloppy
Tryna find some patience like the Lord taught me
Eyes barely open, man, I need some coffee
So I pull up to the shop on the corner
There's no line, I walk straight in and I order
I get my drink, turn around and hit the door when
Somebody stop me and they claiming that they know me

Road,pop,Don Johnson Big Band,2006,"Keep one eye on the road
The other one fixed on the one you hold

The windshield is bombarded by rain
I can only see black and yellow in my brain
As the colors of containers in a dark distance
Flare up in my face like sparks in my pistons
Fuel gage almost pointing at empty
Evidently the high speed has taken a toll
Break and roll very gently down to the waterfront
Maybe ten feet away
My 500 stallions have sent me to stay for a purpose
To observe just a five minute silence
A break from the circus of everyday humdrum
And the effect is like a shock from a stun gun
Some run far, some run fast to return soon
The thought of going everpresent as it burns true
A part of me is always close to the harbor
Sailing with the ghost of my grandfather

CHORUS
Keys in the ignition, headlights rising
Playing with the rain, but the rhythm is random
I sit in abandon with a hand on the wheel
But I'm still unable to leave
Dazed by the slow moving mass of the cranes
Sedated by the memories i only remember to forget
Like a radio signal in a flash
And at last I am cleansed out
If you could see what I see, if you could be in my sleep
If you found me, I'd be lost
No cost is greater than to let go with a past like yours
It doesn't make sense how nothing makes sense now
Stand still, stand still
But the more I command it, the more I know
Leaving is nothing but an act of will
And I feel my diverging path
Has taken me as far as I have to go
Fathers become sons, tables turned
I know that I have been unaware, unconcerned
Now haunted by the thought, I grab the keys
Step outside and see purple
On the road, out on the seas
We'll be reunited within the red circle

CHORUS
Leave a light on, I'll arrive on time this time and try to stay
Leave a light on if the night's too dark, the spark has gone away
Far or near, tomorrow's here
Follow me, and I know the road is clear
What you need now is not me
How could I breathe out all this fear?",3924,68721

Look at me, don't you dare waste more of my air

Poison every letter

Give a rebuttle, you make me sick
Try to be subtle. What's your tick?
Burst your bubble when I see right through you tricks
Don't you go giving me the run around
Silence suits you, don't make those ugly sounds
A mouthful of lead in a hospital bed
Will be more than enough
I cut my weeds till they're dead

Out in club land having fun
And now I'm hiding from the sun
Waiting for a visitor
Though no-one knows I'm here for sure

[Chorus]
Dancing laughing
Drinking loving
And now I'm all alone
In bedsit land
My only home

[Verse 2]
I think it's time to cook a meal
To fill the emptiness I feel
Spend my money going out
I've nothing in I'm left without
Clean my teeth and comb my hair
And look for something new to wear
And start the night life over again
And kid myself I'm having fun
[Chorus]
Dancing laughing
Drinking loving
And now I'm all alone
In bedsit land
My only home

[Verse 3]
I look out from my window view
There's really nothing else to do
Read a book maybe write a letter
Mother, things are getting better
Watch the mirror count the lines
The battle scars of all the good times
Look around and I can see
A thousand people just like me

[Chorus]
Dancing laughing
Drinking loving
And now I'm all alone
In bedsit land
My only home
(x2)

Dancing, laughing, drinking, loving
I'm waiting for something
I'm only passing time",6791,45083
Children of Decadence,pop,Children of Bodom,2000,"Running under cover of the moonlight
Shadow death row. At the night we're
Running wild with no hope for tomorrow...
No tomorrow!!!

As we're walking through the fire
That burns within us all. If ya wanna take
A glance to the blaze of pain, you'll never
Be the same

You wanna get closer and get a taste
Of death? I know ya wanna fuck me down
Til' I'm bleeding red. I couldn't care less
I'll end up rotting in mud, so c'mon mothafucka
And gimme yer best shot

You really thought you'd see through what
I am and what I need, we are children of
Rebellion, we'll fight, we'll bleed
Don't try to come to preach over us and
Over me, we're children of decadence, we're
Right, we're real, we will fight, we'll bleed
We're mothafucking dying breed, we're slowly dying...
All wrecked and fucked I wonder if this is the way
I'm supposed to go. But that is all I ever got, that
Is all I'll ever get, so I just let it go..",2477,96787

Haha well let me tell you

[VERSE1]
Hes a handsome young man
But a straight up G
Intellegent to the fullest
He attracted me
Im not easy to please but he caught my eye
From the first time i saw him i can't denie
That he looks so good so fresh so hood
Kacky beige pants with creeses that stood
And white t-shirt hes so confident
He was heaven sent he became my friend
The more i got to know him the more that i liked him
Hes cocky like me nothing excites him
He dont settle for less hes one of a kind
Good qualities in a men is hard to find
The way he carries himself and the way that he walks
Hell make you fall in love BY the way that he talks
Sexy little smile with some big brown eyes
He deffently stands out from the rest of the guys
[SKIT]

Damn like that
I dont think it was possible and all with your little hard ass
Haha shut up were just tapin
So does he know about the way you feel
[tisk] yeea...were attracting eachother but we never talk about it
So whats the hold up than
I dont know ..i guess im afraid to mess up our friendship and rush into things

[VERSE.2]
We get along so good its so hard to believe
But when we spend time he dont want me to leave
I keep him commpany im always by his side
On the days we dont kick it we just talk all night
He tells me how he feels and how his day was spent
The goods and the bads and the places he went
I dont question his buisness he tells me on his own
All the girls that he has on his celluar phone
They dont mean a thing no more than a fling
I wouldn't wanna feel that way about me
Start hasatate about letting him know the way that i feel
I dont want it to ruin our friendship and love
He means alot to me he became my drug
I dont expose out there and neither does he
We both are hard headed and love to run free
[SKIT]

You really care about this guy dont you i think you should just tell him

Something in your eyes, lets me see right through you
There's no mystery what's on your mind
Something in the way, I always make you crazy
It's a mystery. I don't know why

Get out your best line
Take your best shot, baby

You won't be all alone, down there on the floor

But there's just no way that you can call this love

Everywhere I go, I feel your eyes behind me
Trying to see the things that you can't get
I can feel your heat like an X-Ray through me
I can feel your close, but you're not in yet

Keep your distance
Now, don't come closer
Stay behind the ropes there, where you belong

You can see the garden
But you can't come in the house, babe
You're getting all excited, when you need to say come
Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooooooooooh

This is an infatuation
This is an obsession
This is not the time
It's all about possession

I never look your way

Is just believing
Others say its self decieving
Vinning, childish dreams
To get us through
Deep inside me
Theres a yearning
For true wisdom
Not just learning
I'd trade all my clever questions
For one answer that is true

I do believe
You are the one
The home I've longed to find
My only hope
God's only son
I do believe
I touch I see
That all along
You've longed to be
My lord
My god
Lord you know, I need some answers
Questions eat at me like cancer
Make me once again, a simple child
Help me take the risk of losing
Lose it all to find in choosing
To believe You are the answer
Earth and heaven reconciled

I do believe
You are the one
The home I've longed to find
My only hope
God's only son
I do believe
I touch I see
That all along
You've longed to be

By Our Love,pop,Christy Nockels,2009,"Brothers, let us come together
Walking in the Spirit, there's much to be done...
We will come reaching, out from our comforts
And they will know us by our love...

Sisters, we were made for kindness
We can pierce the darkness as He shines through us...
We will come reaching, with a song of healing...
And they will know us by our love!

The time is now
Come Church arise...
Love with His hands
See with His eyes...
Bind it around you
Let it never leave you
And they will know us by our love...

Children, You are hope for justice
Stand firm in the Truth now, set your hearts above
You will be reaching, long after we're gone
And they will know you by your love!

I Will Carry You,pop,Michael W. Smith,1999,"Sometimes I wonder if my beating heart has a reason
The thought of breathing only takes my breath away

Do I have the strength to make it through the day
But I was never meant
To walk this road alone
I can always trust you
When you say

I will carry you
Be your strength
And pull you through
Reach for me
And take my hand
We will pray
And we will stand
In a world
Crying out for peace
Let your heart be strong
For when I am weak
You will carry me
Sometimes You wonder if the road you're on has a reason
It's hard to go on, when you just don't know
We can shoulder all the weight of life between us
Until the fear of what we cannot see is gone
Cause we were never meant
To walk this road alone
We are bound together

Throw away the key and then turn off all the lights

First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate

Wait, I've got a better plan
To catch this big, red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done, we'll butter him up

Bury him for ninety years, then see if he talks

Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

If we blow him up into smithereens
We may lose some pieces

And then Jack will beat us black and green
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean then see if he is sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I'll bet

Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew, mmm
We're his little henchmen and we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

Shut up!

This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now in the box, we'll wait and hide
Until his curiousity...

Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him, one, two, three

Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick

Was unlovable

Where there was guilt and shame

And You are mine

Peter and the Wolf Op. 67,pop,Sergei Prokofiev,1936,"This is the story of Peter and the wolf

Each character in the tale is going to be represented by a
Different instrument of the orchestra. For instance, the bird will
Be played by the flute. (Like this.) Here's the duck, played by
The oboe. The cat by the clarinet. The bassoon will represent
Grandfather. The wolf by the French horns. And Peter by the
Strings. The blast of the hunters' shotguns played by the kettle
Drums

Are you sitting comfortably? Then I shall begin

Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and went out into the big
Green meadow

On a branch of a big tree sat a little bird, Peter's friend. ""All
Is quiet, all is quiet"" chirped the bird gaily. Yes. all is quiet

Just then, a duck came waddling round. She was glad that Peter
Hadn't closed the gate and decided to take a nice swim in the deep
Pond in the meadow
Seeing the duck, the little bird flew down upon on the grass
Settled next to her, and shrugged his shoulders. ""What kind of bird
Are you if you can't fly?"" said he. To this, the duck replied ""What
Kind of bird are you if you can't swim?"" and dived into the pond

They argued and argued, the duck swimming in the pond and the
Little bird hopping along the shore

Suddenly, something caught Peter's attention. It was a cat
Crawling through the grass

The cat thought: ""The bird is busy arguing, I'll just grab him.""
Stealthily she crept towards him on his velvet paws

""Look out!"" shouted Peter and the bird immediately flew up into
The tree, while the duck quacked at the cat, from the middle of
The pond. The cat walked around the tree and thought, ""Is it worth
Climbing up so high? By the time I get there the bird will have
Flown away.""

Just then, Grandfather came out. He was angry because Peter had
Gone in the meadow. ""It is the dangerous place. If a wolf should
Come out of the forest, then what would you do?""

But Peter paid no attention to his grandfather's words. Boys like
Peter aren't afraid of wolves
But Grandfather took Peter by the hand, locked the gate, and led
Him home

No sooner had Peter gone than a big gray wolf came out of the
Forest

In a twinkling, the cat climbed up into the tree. The duck quacked
And in her excitement jumped out of the pond. But no matter how
Hard the duck tried to run, she couldn't escape the wolf

He was getting nearer, nearer, catching up with her. Then he got
Her and with one gulp swallowed her

And now, this is how things stood: the cat was sitting on one
Branch, the bird on another, not too close to the cat
And the wolf walked round and round the tree, looking at them with
Hungry eyes

In the meantime, Peter, without the slightest fear, stood behind
The gate watching all that was going on. He ran home, got a strong rope. and climbed up the high stone wall. One of the branches of the tree around which the wolf was walking stretched out over the wall

Grabbing hold of the branch, Peter lightly climbed over on to the
Tree. Peter said to the bird:  ""Fly down and circle over the
Wolf's head. Only take care that he doesn't catch you.""

The bird almost touched the wolf's head with his wings while the
Wolf snapped angrily at him, this side and that
How that bird teased the wolf! And how the wolf wanted to catch
Him! But the bird was clever, and the wolf simply couldn't do
Anything about it

Meanwhile, Peter made a lasso and carefully letting it down and
Down and down, caught the wolf by the tail, and pulled with all his
Might

Feeling himself caught, the wolf began to jump wildly trying to
Get loose

But Peter tied the other end of rope to the tree, and the wolf's
Jumping only made the rope round his tail tighter

Just then, the hunters came out of the woods, following the wolf's
Trail and shooting as they went

But Peter, sitting in the tree, said: ""Don't shoot! Birdie and I
Have already caught the wolf. Now help us take him to the zoo.""

Now just imagine, just imagine the triumphant procession. Peter at
The head. After him, the hunters leading the wolf. And winding up
The whole procession, Grandfather and the cat

Grandfather shook his head discontentedly. ""Well, if Peter hadn't
Caught the wolf? What then?""

Above them flew Birdie chirping merrily. ""My, what brave fellows
We are, Peter and I! Look what we have caught!""

And if one would listen very carefully, he would hear the duck
Quacking inside the wolf, because the wolf, in his hurry, had
Swallowed her alive",7563,41409

And make good what has been just so bad

On your front lawn

But that's not how it's supposed to be

I'm in town
And every piece
Of mind you put down…

I stare at my reflection
I don't know who I am
Practice my confession

I'll say I learned my lesson
I'll be a better man

I'm wiping down the walls

I'm walking through the halls

So I'll ask her when she calls

I show up at her doorstep
To look her in the eyes
I tell her that it's me
But she doesn't recognize
Can't you see I'm running?
Said I need a place to hide
I've gotta ask you something
Could you please let me inside?
Just let me explain
No I wouldn't tell you lies

Wake up in wonder

Or is it just out here?
Tell me Lorca
Tell me how it is

Drinks are on the house and it's getting crowded

Jump into the pool, we're just getting started

Am I meant to sit here
And just take this
When you promised me that I would be the one that you would never leave
I can't believe I fell for what you said
Does it make you feel good to make me feel less than I am?
Does it make you feel strong? Like you're a bigger man?

Did I love too much? Is that what this is about?

Fuck you, I hate you

Riding 'round with a lot of money so I keep my Glock
I blew up super fast, guess that's why they mad
Touch my chain, murder scene, body bag
I do this for all the shit I never had
Gotta be her for my niece, ain't got no father, I'm her dad
You remember we was skipping school
Going on the move, fucked around and made the news
I'm so glad we didn't get caught
Looking back on it, I'm like damn I came far

They know when I'm telling the truth

As I Unfold,rap,Kembe X,2014,"[Verse 1: Kembe X]
Well if it isn’t them purple smoking, swerving
Deeper than the ocean, higher than the birds
I speak it into motion, be cheefing like a stoner
But sleep with the emotions of feeling like a loner
Put it in the air with the squad, good God we faded
High, tryna figure out how we made it
Mogs tryna figure out how I knew
Living life, how I like, that’s just how I do
Ain't got rid of my bitch, though she creeping on me
Whole time I’m more worried ‘bout who sleeping on me
Negative I don’t believe, so don’t speak it on me
I’m the man, ain’t a mother fucking secret homie
I got the Backwoods and we cheefing homie
The Triple Sevens my squadron still
And keep it moving with the drama, bitch
Let’s make it clear that I’m tryna chill
And I’m never in a rush
When I’m with your bitch I duck, cause she probably finna bust
Lying means I give a fuck, to me honesty is clutch
Fuck around and hit it once, that’ll probably be enough
And I’ll probably be above the fuck shit
A nigga with substance, what up to the Village
Niggas built it from nothing, a dream and a little assumption
Left her friends for my crib on some literal fuck shit
What up bitch

Well if it isn’t that OG smoking purple potion
Soulo Ho, so much commotion
I wrote songs with so much devotion
I’m wavy, I flow in the ocean motion
I’m crazy, my brain an insane asylum
Obey me, I’m Godly and omnipotent
Uranus as plain as the game without him
Him being I, seeing eye'm so focused
Black lip pastor, hazard hazard
The resonant frequency if matter matters
Backwoods, extra pills, seals untampered
With, Whit, have my shit right when I land sir
I drew the landscape and I won by a landslide
Everything’s mine when I land and my mind’s a land mine
I know you can’t comprehend the Son of Man
That’s on my mom and them, yup
Kembe X, Ab-Soul and the dash separate the B-S
My delivery’s so TDE, I was a app away from U.P.S
As I unfold, these brand new socks and drawers I want it all
Don’t let me enter my zone
I just wanna hit the ATM and enter my code

Then you pull out the 9 and then blast him

Walk with his fist clinched he was itching to blow
Shit, and all the local neighborhood niggas would know
It's like he was born to fit the streets
Never had no chicken feet
Walked up to the local liquor store to get a swisher sweet
Before he walked in some dudes was like
“Aye Nigga...POP POP POP, we don't play nigga”
They just shot him when his lives undone
The man inside the liquor store dialed 911
And at the same time he's strugglin' tryin' to find someone
Screamin' “HELP HELP, STAY ALIVE YOUNG SON!”
The boys gonna die and he knows that

Step in the room and doom and get your mood beat up
You’re fucking right I eat you up, I got you feelin' like you’re up on Jupiter
Some o' them on some other shit, smother shit
I really don’t wanna sit here and infectin' niggas ears with your swag crap
Talking about your face and how you’re rich
I bet you wish you was the shit, my nigga backpack
Some will say it’s ignorant, curse you like deliverance
Don’t mean no disrespect, but no respect is what you gettin' shit
Nobody wanna be you on the TV screen, get what I mean?
You fuck around with me, you get my alcohol belligerence
And people call me crazy, but I don’t give a fuck
If you got more money than me,you ain’t never on my level
Put you in the abyss and now your people’ll rest in piss, and I will send you to the de-vil
Ain’t fucking with no radio, that’s gotta be the worst shit
I heard up in my life, and now executives control it
I guess I keep impressin for the west
Like I was death and keep off messin with my old chick
Put it up in the deck and turn it up because the shit is sick
Banging out the trunk and you could bump it with the sickest bitch
They say I’m the wickedest, could just split your wig
With some of the venom, sippin' the gin and juice, induce you with inequities
?You tumble and run in a mountain? Who was doubtin'? Look how they Brainsick shoutin
Feel I’m with my people when I’m on the fucking stage
You only want the money, it ain’t funny, callin' niggas bummy
Buyin' all your Cd’s to get you motherfuckin paid

Want me to drain you for your blood and leave your body left lifeless

Pull up on you, hella faded bustin' out the mini van
They can try to run, I guarantee they will not make it

Do when I’m on top of you, pullin’ the trigger, leavin' a nigga
Screamin' about his life, like he was riddled, but he wasn’t hit
I can fucking kill him but, that would only mean
That I will have to waste a bullet, ‘cause to me he really wasn’t shit
I take his blood and smother it
Make a happy face upon the window while you’re lookin’ at me through the other side like…
Now you’re comin' face to face with Jason in the flesh and bringin death to a nigga, bye bye
Took him up out his misery, turn him up into history
Sever the meat, I need to eat, at least I got the victory
Comin' to me, you need to cease before I get the heat, ?capiche?
I’ll touch you with the piece and then I leave the scene, a mystery
People on the radio be thinkin' that this shit is cool
Wearin' skinny jeans, bright pink and a monkey suit
I don’t really wanna hear this shit no more
I’ve had it up to here with this, I made a wish and hopefully it’s coming true
I post up in bat cave, with a black bat, like I’m Batman
But I’m just a bat up out of hell
He tried to tear my hair, boy, did I tell you that he failed?
I come back from the grave and then I see you straight to tell
That motherfucker that this shit isn’t my cup of tea
And I won’t listen to it if it was the last on earth shit
Put it in the dirt, man, I know your feelings hurt
But I ain’t really heard no worse shit
I don’t really listen to it, keep it on the under-
Ground, makin' my speakers pound like it was a thunder
When is everybody gonna realise the game is in demise
And everybody is blind as Stevie Wonder

Dancing in the Rain,rap,Taylor Bennett,2015,"[Refrain: Taylor Bennett]
In the rain, ain't no pain
I've seen days, dark in shame

[Verse 1: Taylor Bennett]
My heart aches, like an AK
Hit my chest, that's a heartbreak
I can sleep, but I can't rest
Wake me up, when I ain't pressed
Press my suit, early wake guest
Seen first last, first blessed rest
Tears turn rain to oceans
Pain floats high, we deep in
I don't mind (I don't mind)
I don't mind
Dancing in the rain

Baby, can't we
Drop our worries and dance in the rain

Drop your worries and dance through the pain

In the rain, ain't no pain

My heart breaks, like a glass vase
What could ever make you wanna take a break
Tryna break the ice it's thinner than a glacier
Waterfalls and tears be feeling like the same thing
I be falling talking drowning in my sorrows
You be like okay I'll call you back tomorrow
We should take this fight outside go grab your poncho

I doesn't have time for this shit
Ain't never had time for this shit
Sometimes I cry like a bitch and pretend that my eye got an itch
Hop in the whip and let's ride
I'm on some Criminal Minds
Fuck all that limited time shit, I live infinity lives
I didn't ask for yo' money, I'm sick of asking for money
I'm sick of being nobody, I'm sick of having nobody
I'm sick of being so dumb, I'm sick of them being dumber
In the winter we slumber 'til the Indian summer
We getting mentally challenged
Leaning then left you unbalanced
Put yo' ass to the gas please bitch, I'm emptying gallons
Sho' we smoking the purp, police smoking the perp
Holy smokes homie, I'm so mediocre it hurts
Lord, the streets are so vicious
Law don't need your permission
Y'all whole team full of bishes
Y'all gon' sleep with the fishes
Tell her empty the cash register, empty the cache
Empty the ashtray, better empty the trash
Better move with the movement
Get some proof and then prove it
Recruit the troops, get in tune with the music
Been a muse for amusement, sniffing 'caine with a nose bleed

Get it done when I show up
Hit and run, I got no love so your lips are gonna get sewed shut
I'm just living to die
Sick of talking myself out of quitting and sitting inside
I admit I'm a little bit high, a brilliant mind blind to civility
I'm head over heels, hoes kick their heels over their heads
Bullshit, you ain't getting a deal
Your whole clique's mediocre at best
Show biz got me holding my cards
I'm keeping them close to the vest
I'm feeling Napolean-esque
So you need to know I'm in charge
I screw Betty Boop in a Bentley Coupe
Like hurray for me and to hell with you
Man, it's plain to see I'm collecting loot
Got an eighth of weed and a twelfth of brew
Wrist rocket, no Roley on
Criss-cross you like Goldie Hawn
Say ""holy cow, wow, oh my God!""
I'm bringing hip-hop back to the odium
I feel like a million bucks
I really ain't giving no fucks
Been living it up for a living
A party of one at the crib in a tux
I've risen above the meridian
I've sunken below the surface
Definition of dunce and of idiot
These songs are my only purpose
Now I'm buckling under the strain
I'm stuck in a rut every day
I'm jumping in front of a train for the fun of it
Comfortably numbing the pain
Stumbling stray but I come right back
In fact, no more running away
Front on my gang and I'll puncture your jugular vein
With the cutlery whadda ya say?
Fit as a fiddle, I've sung in the rain
I've fumbled the ball, yeah
I've swung and I've missed
Yo, once and for all, you dummies ain't fucking with this
I'm earning my keep, you're certain to circle the drain
I've been working to further my reach
So you should be learning my name

No one understands my pain
And my parents never listen
I'd rather die than feel this way""

Don't cry, don't die
Give it two years, it'll only take time
And you're never ever ugly with a smile that bright
No, your parents don't listen but I swear they wanna try

Know you're stressed, and depressed, and your hair is a mess
But you're cute when you lose or you're mad at your friends
And I hate when you cry every time that I said
""Oh I love when you're here, I don't want this to end""
Can we not talk school for once, it makes me nauseous
Everyone in class is either mean or real obnoxious
And I'm sorry that I said it, but I felt so fuckin' lost
It's like my life is just a token either spent it or you lost it

Here I'm sittin', eye inside the storm ensuing
Waiting, being patient for the rain to ruin

I swear the taste of success is so bittersweet
But I ain't one to complain, no woah is me
You probably wouldn't get it 'less you had these memories
Feels like every setting that I step in is just meant to be
What do I do with all these kids lookin' up to me?
When I got scars on my heart that they've never seen
Before I ever logged on to computer screens
I had nightmares and turned 'em all into dreams
Before I ever did no interviews
Before I ever hit a milli' views
Before I was anybody that someone paid attention to
I was just like you

And it's hard feelin' off when you're puttin' on

All the bridges that were burned led to empty roads
Got the bay on fire even when it's cold

And I'm so motivated
Turn the negative into my motivation

Caught in the Hustle,rap,Immortal Technique,2001,"[Verse 1]
They say the odds against me are crooked and impossible
Like I was born with a hole in my heart as an obstacle
I was left to die by the doctors in the Children's Hospital
But I never lose hope, success is psychological
The world is volatile and the street is my education
Shapin' the nation, like the blueprint of a Mason
While Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion
So I'm focused on my economic situation
I'm like the little kids on TV that dig through the trash
I hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh
A lot of niggas drop science, but they don't know the math
Because their mind is narrower than the righteous path
It's funny how on the block niggas will kill you for cash
But never raise the gun and cry out, ""Freedom at last!""
The cold war is over, but the world is still gettin' colder
Atlas walkin' through the projects, with the hood on my shoulders
I would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers
But then a general will decide when their life would be over
So I work hard until my personality's split
Like the Black Panthers, into the Bloods and the Crips
They said I would never be shit, but now I sit and reminisce
Like Yeshua ben Yusef flippin' through Genesis
Ignorance is venomous, and it murders the soul
Spreadin' like a virus, runnin' rampant, out of control
[Hook]
So if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle
Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble
Spray paintin' on the streets and at the subway tunnels
Write it down and remember that we never gave in
The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else?

[Verse 2]
Immortal Technique in the streets, back on the hustle
‘Cause three strikes will get you life for stuffin' cracks in a duffle
Upstate, behind steel gates, attacked in a scuffle
Razor blades stuck on the side of pencils hacked through your muscle
But the emptiness is what bleeds you to death when it cuts you
And it's the lawyers, not the inmates, schemin' to fuck you
Tryna fight the system from inside eventually corrupts you
But that's what you get when you put a corporation above you
And it's the people that love you that seem to hurt you the most
Sometimes when they die, you find yourself cursin' their ghost
But you make success, nobody delivers your fate
Sometimes you give and you take
Since prehistoric vertebrates crawled out of the lakes
And that's the truth about life
Or to do it to ghetto and your car, rims, and your ice
'Cause even though we survived through the struggle that made us
We still look at ourselves through the eyes of people that hate us
But I'm going to make it regardless of the trumped up charges
And semi-automatic barrages that empty the cartridge
Post-traumatically scarred kids that try to be brave
Because niggas backstab each other just to try to get paid
Turn cannibal, like knights during the crusades
Afraid of responsibility, addicted to greed
Beatin' their girl, purposefully losin' a seed
As if we were bound to the destiny we used to receive
[Hook]
So if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle
Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble
Spray paintin' on the streets and at the subway tunnels
Write it down and remember that we never gave in
The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else?

[Bridge/Outro]
I used to wonder about people who don't believe in themselves
But then I saw the way they portrayed us to everyone else
They cursed us to only see the worst in ourselves
Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurtin' ourselves
I used to wonder about people who don't believe in themselves
But then I saw the way they portrayed us to everyone else
They cursed us to only see the worst in ourselves
Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurtin' ourselves

I used to wonder… {*echo*}",73149,11981

Cut the small talk, stop the loose lips

It’s ‘bout 30 niggas, and we all crips
Ain’t no lacking nigga, got 30 in the clip
Just left the gun store, too many bodies dropping
Just got a bankroll

My homie lost it
Found out that he crossed me
Got to be cautious ‘cause this paper getting larger

Riding around with a loaded AK

Switched up on my pivot, now I’m really getting it

It was a hot night in August, (a hot August night), humid
Hit the store to get some O.J. to shroom with
Ooh, shitty, I'm in the world's biggest little city
Seen a girl with some big ass titties
A top notch saditty, bitch knew she was pretty
Get goosed in the city, get your purse took
When I stepped in her life she felt the earth shook
Before I spit the first hook, let me lace ya
Fucked her, had her crying like somebody maced her
Gave her a taste of some real macaroni
She swore she would do, anything for me
That's no bologna, baby brought me bread
Freaked me on the freeway on the 80, gave me head
She neva seen, a sav in some Timbs
Push an S5 sittin' on some Davin rims

[Verse 2]
Listen, you wouldn't want to miss this
I met this bitch the night before Christmas
Baby made my hit list Christmas night
She let a nigga hit by the Christmas lights
This bitch was tight, just my type
Barely ripe, ride a dick like a bike
Hit a dick like a pipe, quick late night hype
Them the kinda thangs that makes my night
The steak ain't right without the A-1
So I stay dipped in sauce and they come
Like baby did, like that nigga old lady did
Like Karen, Kameka, and Katie did
It's crazy, kid, mami on my bozack
I'm pimpin' and she knows that
Nigga, where the hoes at?
Bet they neva seen, a sav in Timbs
Push an S5 sittin' on some Davin rims

Me and Black Jesus went to Rosaritas
Seen senoritas eating carnitas
I was rocking my Adidas sneakers
Told the waitress, ""get me fajitas""
Gold teethas, left her speechless
Gave me the number with a Fairfield prefix
Dipped to the Cougar, put up the Ruger
In the stash spot, a wise maneuver
Put up the cougar, pulled out the MB
California Hot Boy, MD
The boss, that do the firing and hiring
Sweat a broad, I keep 'em perspiring
She's admiring the way I slide
The way I ride, and how her boyfriend lied
She's neva seen a sav in Timbs
Push an S500 sittin' on some Davin rims

She only sees me, with woodgrain Sprees
She only sees me, with Champelli trees

Razorblade me, but it's you I got cut from
Sitting in the back 'cause I really can't love none
Times goes by but my mind won’t follow that
I won’t hit you up but still wonder why you don't call me back
Why you talk like that? Why I couldn’t walk right back?
Yeah, go off like that, why I take a loss so bad?
Gotta cop a bag, just to get out of my bed

Got me hating everything
And I don't know, no, I don't know
Where I can go from here

Yeah, hidden scars
In a spot where niggas don’t want niggas knowing I'm a star at any cost
Never waited for doors, was taught to barge in
Learned it off the margins
Flirting with the hard shit
Urchin in the government eyes
Perfect in mom's, shit
Admonishing my cough
Acknowledge it but quitting's in the opposite of cards dealed in 5 percenter laws instilled, father did his part really
Ball is in my palm spinning
Watch it till I'm nauseous
Guided from the inside so my
Pride is just my loss really
Guarded by a garcia vega
If scarlet sparkle behind my car, see ya later
The barsmans saw enough of narcs and I'm saying
I'll take the nigga hitting cars up over cops any day, who more often called upon for guarding all the chocolate babies
I would wait, but I got a few more bars left to say
So in good faith: fuck the army and the law and the banks
Expect bacon if my arm caught crossed with the jakes
I bring it home
Your face card in the street bro we can know what it say
Y'all niggas moving like New England videos of the plays
We Ray Lewis when they open the case
Ay, they made me take fluids eight days and nights my stomach a cave
I done seen the heat of Summer turn my brother insane
Seen a lil piece of plunder turn my brothers to snakes
I take that L to the chest the other one melting my brain
Purgatory lurker
Surprised the white boys ain't getting word around about serving us
The facts of that can't serve us 'cause I advocate for truth, truth answer me back in person
Certainly wasn't always having, we always had this shit working though
We always had this shit working though
Never had no personal feelings toward the merch we stole
Purging everything pure hellscape vertigo
Curmudgeon pledged to keep it curtailed till the curtain close, nigga",11710,47218

[Verse 1: Tugga]
Loose is known for doin' the bangin', bangin' (Bow, bow)
Sin Squad pull up, they panic
Fore Street Mac D's, I had you dashin' (Runner)
OSav caught up and gave you a splashin' (Dickhead)
You don't wanna buck Bully with his chopper, he left Fouyad with his ear all flappin' (Pussy)
The way WhyS dropped was fucked
Should've seen the way that Trilla splashed him (Ahh)
Suttin' got tanned in the 9
My mum's like, ""Oh no, what happened?"" (I don't know)
I said, ""You're late on news, the gang's just done a quadruple stabbing"" (You know)
I bored DV in his face
Like, come and taste this splashin'
Any block that thinks they're bad
Come Park Lane, we'll show you 'bout badness

[Chorus: Trills]
Park Lane bopping, the opps dem droppin'
Come here, I got you a coffin
12 gauge long like Kelvin's coffin, his girlfriend keeps on boppin'
This money ain't stoppin'
The opps keep runnin', I'm runnin' 'em down and they're trippin' and droppin'
I'm runnin' 'em down and they're trippin' and droppin'
Park Lane bopping, the opps dem droppin'
Come here, I got you a coffin

I'm runnin' 'em down and they're trippin' and droppin'
[Verse 2: Tugga]
When I see them, I hop out the ride
I don't play games with these fuckin' pricks (I don't)
Tuggzy got bored and snitched for switchin' sides, are you takin' the piss? (Fuck)
She thought that she could come to my crib on a chillin' ting, what a stupid bitch (She buzzin')
Mello, Chop, Lampz, all of them got put in my spliff (Dead up)
Talkin' bad, man purge on your block
Tryna kill black yutes like the Ku Klux Klan (You know)
I saw OSav wettin' him, I backed out my chingers, like, ""Lemme get two on that""
Takin' risks, the 9 boys don't know 'bout that (They don't)
Shouts out my brodie Blacks
Somali boy, that's trapped in the trap (You know)

[Chorus: Trills]
Park Lane bopping, the opps dem droppin'
Come here, I got you a coffin

Shake my hand at the show
But you hating on the low
Heard you like the way I flow
Got to stream like a O (cean...)
Working on these rhymes
On the clock, never waste time
On the ladder and I got to climb
To the top, 'cause the case mine
Feet up in the trap, I don't even wanna rap
Put my city on the map, in the church doing laps
Whippin' and flippin' and throwing up 4's
Banging up West and cooking on the stove
You thinking you 'bout it, they kick in the doors
Leaving you dripping like the water hose
Body dry if you keep running your mouth
From Montgomery, Alabama: we ain't never seen a drought
You can drown, 'cause we up right now
And we living for a purpose 'til we float up to the clouds (Aye)

[Verse 2: Big Yae]
Never thought I'd be on a classic beat
But I ain't got no limit, no Master P
I'm bout to kill the beat, another casualty
Yep, it's 'bout to be another tragedy
And then I'm gonna walk out casually, dazzling
Like this is actually happening
Don't miss this masterpiece, it has to be ecliptic
You don't see? Then, put it on yah wish-list
We gon' ride out for the winter
I call up my friend and we go out to dinner
I think I should date her, 'cause that'd be a winner
They wish that I would, I'm not talking bout splinters (Nah)
But I got to stack up the plates (Go bigger)
Then, I'm gon' be bouncing away (No Tigger)
And Jt would want to put me on a song
That got something to do with some weight (Go figure)
I do this to show you my God
Aye, that's why I go hard for the Lawd, yah
Your sodium levels be high, aye
You need to cool it with the salt, yah
I'm losing some weight in a minute, aye
And you can believe it or not, yah
But I don't keep none of the glory for myself
I give all the glory to God, yah

Illusion,rap,Tinie Tempah,2010,"[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
My neighbours keep gettin' mugged so we sleep with the alarm on
Bedroom filled with Nike SBs and Comme Des Garçons
Staring at the ceiling listening to So Far Gone
Tryna make the world pay me pay me daily like carson
My mom say I need to put on weight like Kelly Clarkson
She say I work like a soldier steady marchin'
Left right, left right, left right, left right
Tryna keep it smelling like Elizabeth Arden, ahh
Apartments, yard river garden
Money in the jeans, car key in the cardigan
When I was a kid I wished that I could be in Narnia
Every time my father disregarded an argument, ahh
Wishin' I was sitting on the moon, watching videos
Wishin' I was living on a shoe, with dishonest youths
Doing things I didn't wanna do
Wishin I could see the world through a different point of view

[Hook: Tinie Tempah (Sam Frank)]
Leave your baggage at the stairs and your worries at the door
You don't have to think about problems anymore
(I can make you, believe in anything)
Uh, I know that everything's changed
But I'm under this illusion just so I don't go insane
(I can make you, believe in anything)
[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, you ever been too fed up to get up
Or wish you had a huge shredder for a few letters
Dreaming up these stories of these whole new adventures
Like blue Louis Vuittons on the new Cinderella
Check your sense of humour on the new rumours getting better
But I'mma teach you a lesson
And I don't mean a lecture
Cause only fake [rich, rich] dudes get jealous
And we'll never let a [rich, rich] dude get near us
Cause we're up with the stars, somewhere in outer space
Cause on the underground I felt so out of place
I got Tom, Dick and Harry all lookin' at my face
I know they wanna say safe but don't know how to say it
Bad body language, I don't understand it
When they see Patrick then they all turn to gangsters
Hehe, And that's a passage from my mantra
I started reading from a whole different chapter

[Hook: Tinie Tempah (Sam Frank)]
Leave your baggage at the stairs and your worries at the door

A low ha when they talk crazy, buenos nochas
All of us is ovals, circle one, that's perfect
I ain't seen an nawh' one like my mama closed the curtain
Don't be flirtin' with your gift, you better marry it—you nervous?
Don't be scared of euurk euurk nothing
I'm scratching those been fronting
Never played the lottery like y'all, most of that's worth nothing
Got no time or money to be wasting, honey, honey

Lack masculinity, I miss you
Sad they call it hate when we speak on some of them issues
But we can't go ssshhh no more
I'm just trying to be all I can be for y'all
Cause Ruby Dee and Maya's gone
And we gotta keep the fire strong
Back when my hair was long
And I was 100 pounds watching Viacom
New the powers of words
Rapping about more than what cars we on
Zim Zimmer, who got the keys to the Beamer?
I like to party too, who got balloons and some streamers?
I dream of arenas like Arenas playing in
But they say that the music I'm making ain't paying many dollars
My purpose is priceless, lah lah
La La Anthony got hazel eyes
See the world the same in brown and green
Think money make you, you ill advised
We can't change like dyes
So make music like this so you don't forget
And always remember and recognize

O.P.P.,rap,Naughty By Nature,1991,"[Intro: Treach]
Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em

[Verse 1: Treach]
O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""people,"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple, huh
It's sort of like, oh well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?
You get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)
It's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it
There's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership
[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)

[Verse 2: Treach]
Well, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letters the same, but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word rhyming with ""cleanest"" or ""meanest""
I won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly
I'll say the last P, hmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?
And you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away
He had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet door
Now don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.), I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount
[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies)

[Verse 3: Treach]
A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must've been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming, so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you, Treach,"" I said, ""Now, child, please
You gots to leave, come grab your coat right now, you gotta go""
I said, ""Now look, you choose the stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was O.P.P., hell, from the very start""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting, isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her, for sure, I'm going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it
[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)

Niggas predictable, they go left but can’t finish
Sheetrock thin, neighbors in my business
Annie Lennox, Al Green penance
I’m a black hole, I’m a light bender
Water cold I’m a night swimmer
One baobab in the desert fire
Woods for the peasant pope the king’s pheasant
Roast over open coals, no kitchen
Piles of cracked chicken bones, the neighbor goat missing
Ochre out the throat where the blade kissed him
Entrails spilt, there was never a vision
There was never nothing in ‘em
The sky was indifferent, the ground hold bitter cassava
They lie ‘bout the loaves and the fishes
But not that road to perdition woooo

Boil blending oil to please our scalp
Just a drip of each, I keep moving east
Rising up out of reach, unacknowledged and I'm in need
Please don’t call me king, no
We can't have all the things
Terabyte, gigabyte, niggas bite
I heard ass taste better in the summertime, split her thigh
Thunder in the sky rolling wide
Spun a vibe that didn’t feel like
You were running for time or from it
Fireflies in the jar, poke a hole so I can breathe
Steez hard to earn get up off your knee
See, I’m not the one to lean on
I'll give you what you need

Here we go

In a world where the world ends at the end of your block
And them uh, little whirlwinds spin friction 'round the clock
I'll be savage, hunt and gather the average rather cadaver
Cock back hammer, splatter matter all over cell phone and camera
No peace, yeah, in the middle of a war zone, riddle when the norm thinks slow
No sleep, yeah, with the shades down low, on the down low fighting with a dream
I creep, yeah, all secrets please, I don't need to speak
I'm paranoid like a man in the land of the free
To set up and let us burn and turn cheek, damn
Stop with the octagon, top your block, I'm gone
Off my rock, no songs, no more locked, yeah
Just a little bit a prison for everyone of us
We won't listen till there isn't any more of us
These days we quick to part ways with rights like ""okay""
Here, let's be clear, for the record I did not sign up for lockdown
Or any kind of shock and I'm so bored

You must have forgot just who you were dealing with
Nothing less than aggression so naked, so crystal clear
With a trust in absolutely fucking nothing but Doomtree
Step up your thought game lames, we're all thirsty

It's like they leave us no option
Walking these streets, heat is watching
These preachers speak from their pockets
These teachers- bring it back, c'mon
These teachers reach but can't stop it
Seedlings so poisoned, so lost and
Follow these prophets to nonsense
Tossing what's right to the dust
And I ain't no casualty
Got no surface with spotless morality
My dirt might have to cover up my grave
But I keep my fear of faith
And filth clutter up my cave
Got me looking for disinfectant

Who else but me, can see the state of emergency that we face
Cause wearin of certain clothin can get a brother a case
Talkin pants, Air Force Ones, and a baseball cap
It's casual, but to authorities it mean you sellin crack
It's a shame I can't ride on the rich side of town
Without bein pulled over, thrown on the hood and patted down
Searchin my person for weapons and drug paraphenalia
It's rough on a thug that's what I'm tellin ya
When I say thug, I don't mean I'm 'sposed to be locked behind bars
Cause my acronym for thug is True Hero Under God
But still I'm a criminal cause I got gold teeth
Ain't no justice for blacks, just-us with no sleep
And they wonder why I keep a Glock 40 on my hip
Cause Houston police department love to empty full clips
Accidental death? Bullshit! They murdered all my eses
Chinga tu madre de policina bust ya cuete
If they get out of line, I get out of line
I'll be damned if I don't fight for my freedom and don't mind dyin
Already got one foot in the grave, ain't shit for me to jump in
Almost overdosin on codeine, heart barely pumpin
I'm high all the time, straight addicted
Paranoid, my dog might be a detective, so I don't wanna kick it
Even though I don't rob banks or sell street rocks
I still be callin collect to Trae to say, come bail me out
This crooked-ass America, I swear they got some game
Every city I travel to, the situation the same
I can't even say it's racial cause I got some white friends
Then again, they get patted cause I'm not a white friend
It's a shame
[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Bad enough they wanna follow me around the sto'
Like I'ma steal somethin, thinkin I ain't got no dough
And if I got alot, they'll think I did a crime for it
Offer me 25, insistin that I sign for it
Why I can't drive a fancy ride and rock diamonds and gold
Why every time I shine you wanna crucify my soul
Under investigation cause the ghetto on parole
Something's wrong, if I'm not flowin it's a shame

[Z-Ro]
27 years of struggle is all I saw
I done lost homies to homies, and homies to the law
Everywhere I lay my head, dere been homicides
I done seen so many murders since the day my momma died
I ain't lyin, will I remit, will I survive, can I breathe?
Cause I don't see too many Christians as murderers and thieves
And I never seen a man cry, until I seen a man die
But he was tryin to do me so I had to make that man fly
Will the authorities understand self-defense
All they give a damn about is who did it and evidence
Screamin guilty to take another thug off the street
Prejudiced prosecutors can't keep no blood off the street
I'm one deep, if I gotta use my burner, I'm safe
I ain't gotta go ""Rollin' on the River"" like Tina Turner
Cause this crooked-ass America, I swear they got some game
Innocent until never found guilty, but still in chains

Weave the whole industry, every jab I've parried it

I'm different from where you shoot shots in the dark
Aiming for something you don't know is there
Or hoping you'll pin when the target is hard

I'm drowning, I'm counting to nothing, to nothing

Put down your gun before you hurt someone
Put down that knife before you take my life
Give me time and I can change your mind
If you tell me your secrets, I can tell you mine
I hear people speak around me
Who's outside the wall surrounding
Dim my lights and close my eyes
I'll be fine, just leave without me

I'm in a trance, I'm hypnotized
Open my eyes but I'm still blind
You're the only one I recognize
The only face I see, face I see
I forgot to mention, I pay close attention
You don't like to listen
You and I are driftin' away
Driftin' away, driftin' away
Driftin' away, driftin' away

All I wanted back was you
And I inside my bed
I used to dream about you all the time
You screamed your favorite song of mine like

I can't help myself, my mind lies somewhere else
In time I'll find some help, I long for some closure

Don't look back, there's 'rales
Take the next right, head straight to the Farm, G
Anti social yutes so we're only one leaning parties
The way Kermit slapped that yute
I swear he should sign up for the army
I'm in love with guwop, the cash
I ain't in love with barbies
Put one hand on Jab, I rise that spin cah that's my chargy
My head back criss like Tucker
Fly out the back seat, say, ""Who's that dargy?""
And if he does wrong and we can't find him
Then we'll turn up at his aunties
I'd rather be in the T house than baked off in a party
Right now I want my hands on a whoosh
Before I have my hands on a Carti

Freedom's a must, free all of the Farm G's

Still hop out crashing this corn
He got bored and he got bored
Don't ride back, shit, what are their thoughts
Jump out Abz, try not get caught
This young and handsome man will pull up to your block
Disobey the law
Got round there, two waps and a sword
Let me show them suttin'
Me and bro took trips with waps
Crash it at your back, rudeboy stop running
I'm chinging that up, no stunting
Hop out the back, Rambos get backed
Me and bro step with shanks, no fussing
I do drills and it's all for the gang
I ching backs if they start running
Free Boogie, that's my brother
Man hop out with this cutter
I suggest if you buck this gang
Buck a yute, turn and switch to a runner
Most man love leaving their friends
Opps get bucked, I keep it one hunna
I back shanks and ching their chests
They breeze off, what a heartless sucker

I've been in the field like Lampard
My bro's been scoring the goals like Kane

You'll ask me why am I so OJ
They're pushing and shoving their friends in a foot chase
How is that shit okay?

So you really know I'm about my pay
And we spoke 'bout the Golden Boot already
You know that we're winning again
I put my blade where your cheek is
I ripped that out now your names Scarface
Don't come round here with your jewellery
I'll pop that shit, now it's in my name
And what are you gonna say?
You can't do shit, just stay in your place
Get your forehead buss on the high road
It looks like you just got dipped in sauce
Bro's been touching the buttons like Sneakbo
And swinging their shanks with force
Little yutes wanna jump on this road ting
I guess they just signed up for a course
I've dussed big men with rambo
It looks like a chickens been chasing a horse
A mouse is chasing a cat
A yute like me get a big man whacked
So lowe all the chat
They don't wanna see man pull up with Jab
And if I see yutes in my distance
No stalling, everyone gets slapped
The dot-dot gets tapped
And I just pray one of them get packed

I like him cah he listens
Bad B on the nizz, she really can't keep her distance

Walk on streets or things on peds
Fuck a 1-2s, 3-0 instead

What you wanna be when you're older?
Cee, I wanna be a drug dealer
Go country and build a phone up
Lil bro, you must be jokin'
How many man in the can turned culprit?
School ain’t for me
Yeah, I hear that, but hold it, just don't lose focus
""You must have a dream or somethin'?""
He just shrugged his shoulders
Mumzy's broke, you know this
So I soon go O for the olders
Like Cench, put man on
I wanna get Ps like you, I'm involved
I don't mind flyin' on-
You're a young boy, everything glitter ain’t gold
For this life I lived, the chance is slim to make it rich
Slept in the bando days on end and it weren’t the way to live
Shortcuts where? Take the stairs, no handouts, no takin' lifts
Pics bare broke with peps, KMT like Drake and Giggs
[Chorus: Central Cee & Lil Bro]
Look, bro, I know how it gets
Everyone eatin’, but you ain't ate
The truth is nobody will feed you in the jungle
But you gotta get fed
I'm hittin' the road instead
I’m not gonna go get a job, that's dead
I thought the roads was cool as a young boy
It's not though, I got mislead
Look, bro, I know how it gets

If a man hops out of the ride with a knife same size as your thigh
Gotta fear for your life
Do you say fake it twice, the violence here gets normalized
A lot of the time it's only rap, but I gotta talk some times
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the trap, I just can't glorify it
You know what Cench? The fuck do you mean?
Fuck your motivational speech
I see you shinin', out of the ends
When's the last time you been in the streets?
You don't even know, I got my bros
And when it gets peak, they back my beef
And just 'cause you made it and got famous
That don't mean that it could be me
Bro, watch your tone, you're movin' mad
Drop that pride when you chat to man
Fuck the street, might frame you in
I'll tell you straight and say how it is
I'll tell you once, won't say it again
So use your brain and take me in
Same man that will back your beef
Same ones that sends statements in
I've seen that shit, shit go left, they'll leave man quick
Get some bread, they'll start to scheme
Go to jail, they'll beat mans chick
I hope shit this make you reconsider the lifestyle that you chose to live (Huh)
Trust, we've all got options, it's London City, not Compton
Let's be honest, you could've went college
I get that your mumzy's an alcoholic
It's been ten years that your pop said holla
But trust me dawg, that's no excuse
Best use that hunger to your advantage
I know that you're smart, but you disregard it
I know that you're feel like you're grown already
But don't be silly, your life just started

Look, bro, I know how it gets
Everyone eatin', but you ain't ate
The truth is nobody will feed you in the jungle
But you gotta get fed
I'm hittin' the road instead
I'm not gonna go get a job, that's dead

Cheap Love // Spoken Word,rap,Eppic,2017,"[Verse 1]
You ain't in it for love
Only meaningless sex
Addicted to women and pornographic images
Only out for her body, booty, and breasts
Get to know her heart. How about complimenting her intelligence

You know what a lady wants from the big screen?
Oh you got expertise?
Then where's the chivalry?
Have you ever thought:
What if you were her father?
While you sexually fantasize
Know that's somebody's daughter

There's more to her than her figure and exterior
Man, when will you ever learn
You say you're a gentlemen, throwing dollars at strippers
But strip her down to find the beauty that lies within her
Oh you think you're the man, with multiple lovers?
You bring her to bed first, before you bring her home to meet your mother?
All you do is take, manipulate, till' it escalates
Now another girl's been raped
She's nothing more to you than a game you play at an arcade
Or a page out of Fifty Shades
Do you know her name as she lies in your wake?
Different day. Different dame. But to you it's all the same thing, cause

It's the way that you've been taught
Your teacher was hip-hop
You want bangin' bods, crop tops, and photoshop
Swipe left. Swipe Right. Another one night stand
Cast the line. Hook the bait. You're an excellent fisherman

Please
Confusing love and lust. Don't get it twisted
She isn't up on display at the Red Light District
What you're after is something so sacred
You could care less
You'll do anything to get her naked

But you're convinced that this is the life, right?
You're trapped in a lifestyle that glorifies
All you ever do is objectify and you wonder why you haven't found wifey, someone to call your bride?

A romantic getaway isn't how it ends
You tell her you love her, then you leave her heart broken
But you got her in your sights
Set the mood just right
You get what you want, but it'll be her that'll pay the price
She should be respected and treated as such
Her heart should be pursued before her body's touched
The damage is done
No cheap love. You're drunk
Get to know the damsel below the makeup",3035,105327

I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me
That’s because of my roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots

[Verse 1]
Hey, I can’t be mad at what got me ahead
I don't regret my ghetto struggle due to my success
It ain't that beautiful to write on overcoming stress
Top Ramen noodle soup, thank pappy for the fact I was fed
Look at me now but all before, ""Hey Mr. Skid Row""
The dirty south ain’t just a name the way I’ve been poor
The projects brown and white, I call it gizmo
Went from a gremlin' to them cars in Jigga's video
Can’t find a meal to a mil, only God know it
No record deal to a deal, I work hard for it
Can I live too? I’m living like my Momma told it
Before you reap it, gotta sew it
[Chorus]
I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me

I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots

[Verse 2]
Hey, still on my Kunta Kinte
Somebody had to bleed just for me to get away
My sister had to leave, I respect her staying safe
Oh yeah, I had to grieve, but I’m stronger to this day
Pain, I can't ignore it, you might say I'm ignorant
I’m mistaking for courage, victory so gorgeous
Make it through two Bush, I can make it through any forest
Hunger gave me the wish, but the bottom is so important
37 ave and 187 street
Miami, Carol City, now I’m part of a legacy
I’m thankful for the hood, what is love without jealousy
There’s only five letters really help me

[Chorus]
I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me
That’s because of my roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots
[Verse 3]
Hey, I know the seeds been planted
It’s damaging my soul, but my dreams been granted
That triple life towards, much deeper than Earth's planet
What could I want more than redoing? I never panic
Gets no lower than the ground beneath your feet
A man will stand for nothing if he falls for defeat
A boulder in the hand better than all in the street
If you look beneath the sand, then we all need a crease
Roots before the branches, roots before the mansions
Roots before your paper crazier than Marilyn Manson
Roots with your grandparents, roots under your canvas
Roots whether you black, white, or Spanish

[Chorus]
I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me

Tall poppy syndrome with the fake shit, yeah

From a place where they judge you off a face
The way you're treated is dependent on your race (That's true)

Everybody from the area together so we ride

See I'm steady with the pen and now I'm ready
What you want?
I don't mess with nobody
I don't got me no hobbies

But I believe it's a pathway

With those tattoos on your face?
Say, boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it

When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah
[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin' in
But if you spit on my fuckin' grave
And wish me Hell, then I wish you well
I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my
Beefs, and things seem
To be looking decent recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter the priesthood
But at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked, so I might say something back
That might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or what I have to
Say on the mic, then you might wanna act just
Like quarterbacks and take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause
I'm a sinner, and I, I got a best friend, best friend
Plus balls and intestines, and they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up the minute I'm ever givin' it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin'
'Cause failure's somethin' I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nuttin', you ain't my best friend, best friend
Who you think I'm talkin' 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a best friend, best friend
Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power, now
When I blackout, power outage—oww
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I'll be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you—blaow
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option
Somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my best friend
[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah",1266372,544
Covet,rap,Beautiful Eulogy,2012,"""This song is called Covet. It goes down in three parts.""

[Verse 1: Odd Thomas]
I heard early in life you deal with the hand your dealt
But it was unconcerned words from people who never felt
Or never needed
I pleaded so many times to be seated among the wealthy
Only to be greeted with a blank look for looking for help
You can see it in my face
Got me dreaming of leaving this place
To obtain a better life for mine
And aspire to provide for my wife and I
I've never been afraid to use my hands
Or get them dirty
In fact I work just as hard as any other man
If I could get just one wish
My hope would be to get one chance
To strike it rich and switch my circumstance
And advance myself to count myself as one of them
You know them
The ones who never have to pretend to be
Who have money for everything
Who never have any enemies
Who write checks then check out
And never have to worry about anything
I wanna live like that
Because what they got
Is a lot more appealing than what I got
They got no care for me
So I should take a little bit of what they got
Why not?
""As we continue on, scene 2 to the story.""

[Verse 2: Braille]
Fast forward past my formative years
And it appears I'm stuck here
Looking back on wasted years
And I got nothing to look forward to
Unclear where to steer
Where to go or
How to get far from here
Far away from the shed where I lay my head
And often shed my tears
Deep down I long for a place to belong
Safe and calm
It seems I always went the wrong way
Now all my dreams are gone
No destination left for me, no destiny to manifest
Trying to catch butterflies
But I got a hole in my net
I want to escape and run away
Because every day I'm forced to fake it
If the opportunity showed it's ugly face then I would take it
And no one would expect it
Guess I never had the heart to tell them I wanted a fresh start, cause I've been barely getting by for a long time
It's easier to leave and never have to see them bleed
And I might sound like a coward
But inside I feel powerless
They say the eyes are the windows to your soul
If so then my windows are broken glass
Shattered pieces that's
Where I hide and keep my secrets at
""And now the story makes a hard turn left. Scene 3""

[Hook: Odd Thomas, Braille, Courtland Urbano] x2
Before the world began and the fall of man
You unfolded the drama of salvation's plan
And though we violate
We're cursed by the law
He sent his son to die
And he absorbed it all
We covet, we kill
Our throats are open graves
We lie and we steal but he still saves
It's happening now
New hearts will burn

[Verse 1: Term K]
Ha, theoretically illiterate
Literally hypothetical
Chemical dependency, the referee is giving me a double technical
You better bet there ain't nobody better
Whether rain or sunny weather, pen an open letter
Been alone, forever be alone, me and being lonesome hella go together
The abominable diabolical
It's a monopoly, I got a monocle
Been at the bottom feedin' with the bottom feeders
A lobotomy is not a reason to cry
Finally got a piece of the pie
I've been seekin' the secret to life
Keepin' in mind, please be advised
Young and freaky people need not apply
Hyperbolic unapolagetic
With the right amount of homicidal
I'ma fight a title fight tonight
About to win the bout upon arrival, save you
Live by the gun, die by the gun
Wish that it was, cry 'cause it ain't
Live like a bum, die like a bum
Did what I done, tried to explain
Hiding in plain sight
Right under stage lights
May bite, you'll be writhing in pain
Ain't like it, then file a complaint
Why you wanna be a wannabe?
I wanna beat it out of you
I really truly wanna
Gotta do what I gotta do
Bobby Booshay, medulla oblongata
I got a tendency to be the pest
The complexion of a deity
A reflection of my enemies
Wasn't ever what it seemed to be
I got a tendency to get upset and mean, I'm seeing red
I never even realized, a million centuries ahead of everybody
Got a tendency to speak a mile a minute, woo

[Verse 2: Acumental]
Couldn't win a race, look me in the face
Put me in the game, coach
Foes brittle, finna break bones
The flow bitter, got your brain froze
So folks shiver when I play shows
I'm cold, drippin', get a raincoat
Both swimmin' to the same boat
We're no different, gotta go get it
Gotta prohibit what I hate most
On a roll, living in the moment
I'm finna blow any minute
Gold in my ticket
No limit to my bankroll
I'ma lay low for a bit
Not a know-it-all but I came close
Plain clothes in the whip on my way home, stickin' to the main roads (Oh)
Never been the one to beat around the bush (Nah)
Say my name, say my name
When I come around you better keep it on the hush
Never in a rut, always in a rush
Roll with us, leave opponents in the dust
When I put the pedal to the floor
This ain't a battle, it's a war
For the record, Acumental settle any score
Better than before
End of the performance, I bet they're begging me for more (Woo!)
Weather any storm like Magellan (Oh)
Soar like a 747
Clever and poetic with the rhetoric
I'm ready for impending Armageddon
I don't edit what I said
To my credit, if I ever said it then I meant it (Woo!)
You're pathetic
Take you to the medic when I put your head up on a plate
Everything is great
Aided and abetted, Term and Ac indebted to the game
Get the fame, get the cheddar, get the cake
Get the bread, I'm 'bout to bake it
'Bout to break it with the fellas
Labeled as a menace
Rake it in, I bet you'll never be the same

Oh no no, not again, break in the mix
Nathan is so amazin', it's sick
What I'm sayin' is I ain't never felt pain from a foul vagrant as this
Makin' 'em sit quietly, abide my every wish
Hey little bitch
I ain't R Kelly but I'm tellin' you
When I'm on the mic, I be takin' the piss
[?] takin' it literal
Fuck conservatives and liberals
Hey, it's political, no it's not
I don't give a fuck, I just like talkin' that shit
If you're smarter than a fifth grader, why you always actin' like a little kid?
With tantrums at random
Tantric sex with phantoms at operas
Oprah does lots of drugs (What? Huh?)
I don't know
Dude's got a scattered brain
Rocking boat shoes
And a pocket chain
Eatin' soul food
With Natalie
Portman
Hair when she had it shaved
Headin' V for Vendetta
Head look like a goddamn fuckin' knot
Now I'm gettin' kinda hot
God, I prolly oughta stop
Call a doctor or the coppers
Give me chocolates and a whopper
I'll be outside of your mom's house
With a flamethrower in my boxers
Helicopters overhead overheard what I said and they said
""Absurd, how could anybody say such things?""
Pissed on the lawn, flipped 'em the bird
Then your mom caught a low five
Straight to the derriere
Then I went for the high five, ha bitch, psych
Fingers through the hair

Blaow! How you like me now?
Don't fuck the style, ruthless wild
Do you wanna get your teeth knocked the fuck out?
Wanna get on it like that? Well, then shout!

Yo RZA, yo razor, hit me with the major
The damage, my clan understand it, be flavor

You could never capture the Method Man's stature
For rhyme and for rapture, got niggas resignin', now master
My style? Never!

3 Foot Tall,rap,Classified,2013,"[Hook]
When you're alone life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're 3 foot tall
When it's just you, well times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall
3 foot tall, like you're 3 foot tall
3 foot tall, when there's no one there to catch your fall

[Verse 1: Classified]
I am from the crossroad, off-road, dodging all of the potholes
On my auto-mobile, hollerin' out ""watch-out""
We lost hope like Bob Hope so what are we supposed to follow?
I'm a leader not an apostle, but I believe in the freedom that God holds (shit)
I'm on the top rope, ready to jump so watch close
Been criticized and boxed out since I was a snot-nose kid
We ain't living for tomorrow, we live for the Lord
Though everybody trying to fit in the crowd, like Where's Waldo?
I freeze time like photographs living for the moment
I'm taking mental pictures reminiscing while I'm growing
When I see the light of day, right away I write away
'Cause things I write and say give me direction like Michael Bay
I need some in my life because my plans ain't never work out
Like when I make plans to work out because everything don't always turn out
How you want them too, honest truth, nah, ain't nothing wrong with Luke
I'll walk this path alone, but I need somebody here to talk me through
But who?

When you're alone life can be a little rough

When it's just you, well times can be tough
When there's no one there to catch your fall
3 foot tall, like you're 3 foot tall
3 foot tall, when there's no one there to catch your fall

[Verse 2: Classified]
Yeah, ayy yo
I know we have our unity, community with everyone I did music with
But over the years they disappeared, not ain't too many still doing this
Feeling like I've gone through war, lost my soldiers on the journey
Feeling like we built the team but only I with the jersey
Yeah, everything comes and goes, I've dealt with the undertow
Keeping my head above the water, pushed on, now I run the show
I know the situation's never perfect, deal with what you got
Never bite your tongue, say your piece, don't let them shut you up
They say everything is about money, nah, only business
If your friends think that, then you hang with money-hungry pigeons
The world is hollow, y'all need to eat, I'm making a pot roast
These people are all for themselves
So I ain't in for feeding no cockroach, uh
Wrong or right, I know the type don't be a gimmick
'Cause everything comes full circle, jerk, get it?
I ain't looking for the exit, I'm trying to show you where my head is
When you feel alone, play my songs and that keeps us connected, check it

When you're alone life can be a little rough

And she a slave to the whips and chain
And then the punchline is slave, the hoes that fall asleep to Cadie

I got inappropriate questions for you before you leave, 'bout what's ahead
You one hunnah? Same story, create a player ass nigga
Threw all yo' money in the club, fundraiser ass nigga
That's far, not smart to keep bricks in the glass house
I'm Wizard Kelly big facing, you boys still Penny Proud
And I watch her mouth move when she talk
Now imagine if she ask if I want to fuck
I'm a different nigga Piccolo, boy, we don't even bleed the same color blood
And I don't condone these unnamed hoes in the castle
Doing dirt under my InuYasha nails, girl be my Kagome
May wanna see you if this bitch don't get put on Davenport
We moving too fast, gotta pause in that pussy like CatDog
And that feel like a mouth, you Deidara with yo' hands, ho
Hurt to let you go, but it feel good to send you home to yo' man smelling like 'Ports

Know I seen you at the Peachfuzz, last couple of weeks

Don't sound too far-fetched, now that you don't got that man

Her insides made of glitter, my mouth shine when I lick her
And these loser niggas be tryna win me over
It's that draw ass pussy, it's hentai ass niggas
Bringing back shit that got deaded, ol' Dende ass niggas, bitch
No, no, I can't fuck with it
No Twitter love that I can't see writing me shit
She found a nigga on Instagram, tap it more than twice, she start liking shit
And I'm pissing yellow DM, and I'm aiming past yo' toilet seat
Bathroom in y'all love-nest, she put her mouth on this sick dick
I fucked yo' ho, I think I love her, spending time for hours
And if I front you an O of strong, is that equivalent to buying flowers?
She smoke Lauderdale kush, so even when I'm gone, feel like I'm at home
And, no, the fame ain't got nothing to do with yo number not being in my phone
And she's so one-of-a-kind, boy, I'll drop her off later
Got me asking questions 'bout the girl next door like, who the neighbors?
Love the soil in the Sprite, and she only pop a quarter
Baby nine hollow-tip, the bitch sound like something I ordered
And there ain't no old Bank$, you don't know the old shit
You losing touch with yo'self, but, bitch, I'm beating my dick
New artist? You never heard of Basquiat, bitch?
Walking 'round all these pussies, just to get my feet wet
And she see traces of her favorite color through the green bottle
Miami Beach water, sponge-bathing, down at the Bikini Bottom
No, these niggas don't hold no guns
These niggas just want me hold my tongue
But let me vibe, I got school in the morning

Evolve while I elevate, take flight, levitate
Breakfast for dinner, I'm cold as a mother, but the summer ain't the winter
Finna, bend a, corner, on a three wheel motion
I'm heading to the ocean, caravan full of cars
Neighborhood stars, up and down the boulevard
We go, till we can't go no more

Dottys fuck spinners you know dat we caused that mad ting

[Verse 1: Cillian]
We do M's like Marks and Sparks, see the undies in passing cars
We put ber dirt on der name
But they can't attempt to tarnish ours
I'm laughing hard we just left him with the largest scar
Then it's straight back to the block
Hope jakes don't clock, let's start this car
Bro said ""Alhamdulillah"", he didn't expect to come this far
If you see us best run or you might get one in your lungs or heart
They ask ""Why do drill?"" They say ""How comes you're smart?""
I say ""I got a passion for violence""
Then I say ""Drillin' is fun"" then laugh
In the woods man practise aim
Deadest features but the backs insane
Swear dat der so naive to be in this beef and lack it's strange
This track is flames, all out attack turn pack again
Man back this strap and aim, straight for his head then tap it bait

Breath fast, I ain't tryna hyperventilate
Forgive me Lord, it feels like I commit a sin a day
Then I wait for them days to turn good again
And get the cake, then I'll tell them that's the winners pay
To win today would just seem like a lavish dream
Know what they mean, everything ain't what it seems
The angels sing and I feel like thats my roll call
And I came with Left Brain, that's my road dawg
Switch lanes? Nah homie I'm a road hog
Brain to the pave look my mind on the road dawg
Said I'm just tryna do this quick like make haste
Don't take more than I can get to prevent waste
My music is like confetti rain when you win a race
And you'll probably lose your mind tryna save face
Scarface, say I got that Montana flow
They know I'm tryna get that Montana dough
Where we go, tell the truth I could never know
I'm just tryna push a Porsche, that's white like Montana snow
And honestly, just for wings I would give it up
So if it's true '12 couldn't come fast enough
And when it comes I just hope I'm on my way above

How you my brother? You tellin' on niggas, I don't understand
I done did hard time for the gang, I'll do it again
I'm tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
But, nigga, I'm with it, don't ever forget it, ain't shakin' no hands
How you my brother? You tellin' on niggas, I don't understand
I done did hard time for the gang, I'll do it again
I'm tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
But, nigga, I'm with it, don't ever forget it, ain't shakin' no hands

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas gon' say what y'all say
We gon' pull up, broad day, ain't nobody tryna play
Okay, 'cause you really wanna have it your way
Gun play, we gon' still get your ass some way
I won't let niggas fuck up my vibe
Niggas really be fakin', disguise
Music been on my mind since '09
Now it's 2021, I ain't wastin' no time
Same nigga, ain't a damn thing change
Programmed not to say no names
I'on drink but I pop champagne
It's for Smelly and E and the SB gang
Fuckboy, you ain't takin' no chain
Want clout, you ain't got no name
Thirty clip, let the whole thing bang
We some young, wild niggas that just can't be tamed
Red beam just to help my aim
Big chop, swear the five gon' rain
They gon' call me insane
Brody died and I still never drop no names
Y'all niggas ain't got no pain
Funny shit, better watch your gang
Who'd've ever thought he'd rock Balmains?
Got a AP flooded, I ain't rockin' no chain
Rap money, flip it like cocaine
New expenses, I gotta maintain
Niggas felt like I ain't had no brain
So I got in the studio and everything changed
Quick blow, I don't gotta explain
I'm still tryna get used to this fame
Pussy boy must've thought it's a game
This life ain't for you, better stay in your lane
[Chorus]
How you my brother? You tellin' on niggas, I don't understand
I done did hard time for the gang, I'll do it again
I'm tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
But, nigga, I'm with it, don't ever forget it, ain't shakin' no hands
How you my brother? You tellin' on niggas, I don't understand
I done did hard time for the gang, I'll do it again
I'm tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
But, nigga, I'm with it, don't ever forget it, ain't shakin' no hands",23355,29548

And by winning...)

My whole team winning, call me Charlie Sheen
Yeah, boy, just call me Charlie Sheen
But this is SA, call us the ANC
I wish somebody would come and fuck with me

[Verse 1: Sy-Er]
I heard y'all talkin' behind my back
Now how the hell you niggas gone front?
Now four dope rappers back on one track
High on 'em raps, musical blunt
Never mind whatever had happened
All the bad rapping, all the bad flashing
Hate with such passion was some bad action like a publicity stunt
Now fans dancing hippidy-hop
Cause this the shit that they want
You could trip or slip
And then fall for shit at the starting line while I Bolt
Cutting niggas, I'm a butcher
From five men to two and a half
These punks cannot replace me
Like Ashton, they so new to that
How Kutcher?
Imagine, you could ever try to beat that
Cause I been in and out of this rap game
Charlie Sheen, rehab (I was in rehab)
Delete that
No comparison when we back
Anger management, I need that
Bitch, I'm passionate, believe that
[Verse 2: Moos]
(Moos
Check
Yeah)
My whole team winning, call me Charlie Sheen
Smoking on Bob Marley green
Sticking to the script, I got a drama queen
Dirty nigga from the south trynna keep it clean
Yeah
This my motherfucking theme song
Jungle fever got me feeling like King Kong
This that swagga shit
I ain't really trynna find companionship
Baby girl, when I'm done, let my fellas hit
She told me, ""Moos, oh, please, don't damage it""
Uh
Got a bad bitch like Minnie Dlamini
And all these Xhosa girls be like, ""Charlie, chini""
They know I never pull out when I'm in it
And maybe when I'm done, I'll take you to the clinic

My whole team winning, call me Charlie Sheen
Yeah, boy, just call me Charlie Sheen
My whole team winning, call me Charlie Sheen
I wish somebody would try to fuck with me

Ain't really with that horse shit, no polo

And you know we make it happen
It's the new moon bitch
Now all my wolves packing
Haha

Hope the money come fast like a quickie, huh?
Whole rap game gone lean on me, it's getting trippy now
Nah, this ain't ArrBeeDub, just E.Li, Moos, Sy-Er and Tricky, huh
[Verse 4: Lil Trix]
(Haha
Okay, okay, okay)
It's ArrBee - shit, no, uh, no
I ain't gone scream that shit on a song anymore
No more god damn diss song anymore
I just wanna be the king in my castle
Making joints with a bunch of niggas
That I once used to call my niggas
And I once used to call bitch niggas
But not E.Li, cause he's always been an asshole
I say fuck that shit
Beef is bullshit
The fact that we got passed that's a relief cause it's stupid
Restored like some fillings in your teeth with that new shit
My dick in that grind, so believe, I keep pushing
Niggas, y'all said I never mixed y'all songs if I ain't on it
But guess what?
Best know that this joint right here is mixed
Cause, ha, I'm on it
And I vomit all over this beat
I spit and shit on it, then eat
Ngishisa njengomlilo
So, shit, I be bringing the heat
I've beaten and slaughtered a yeti
Faced fake motherfuckers already
So if you gone call me the shit
And then tell me I'm shit
I hope you pieces of shit ain't forgetting that...

Now I am (Here's to the Roc')
Hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
(Here's to Roc-a-Fella) It's the Fayettenam
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc')
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up

[Verse 1]
Now to the few niggas out there who heard my last shit
Which if I must say so myself that was a classic
I never been the type to ride my own coat tail
But it's obvious I'm here to stay, a fucking hotel
I came up, I warmed up
The next up, I blow up!
If you ain't peep the trend by now with each rap I go up
Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am
[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Verse 2]
Now may I never slip up or let my grip up
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up -
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up, at least give the nigga common sense to wrap his dick up
Toast, let’s lift up our glasses, then sip up
We fly past they look up
They don't last they give up
They don't blast we clip up then empty
And indeed we hit the target yes these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback
My offense is for real, ay fuck sack, niggas getting coffined in the Ville
Way too often and it feels wrong
New York niggas fuck with me, I got 'em singing Ville songs
Guess it's only right because we grew up singing they shit
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit
Time for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats
A slim nigga making bold statement
Uh, ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga
I'm like, true that yea
In NY but smile every time I flew back there
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here
Don't do that, yo who dat?
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel till 'refs blow the whistle on me
I got a whole fucking city that's just sitting on me
But it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops
They ain't give it all they got so they flop
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot
Now I'm starting and they not-let me show you how to stay hot
I play not, man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog
The same nigga used to chill in the mall
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap
The hero fighting villains just to put the Ville on the map
[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Outro]
Yeah man so shit, this was The Warm Up
Um, what can I say, what can I say?
If you heard The Come Up that was about just a lil nigga from North Carolina man
Fayettnam to be exact
Moved to NYC, chasing the dream
I used college, if y'all niggas don't know, I used college as a tool to get to New York
I ain't have no family up here or nothing like that, I came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college
And the whole time I ain't even think I would have to finish college, I just thought I'd be signed by my freshman year so I wouldn't have to finish college
But it didn't happen like that obviously, a nigga graduated and things started falling into place
I got more focused, I dropped The Come Up
And I look at The Come Up like, how kinda like how I was in high school
Just picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga who did not make the team when he tried out and I know it's a lotta niggas who know that feeling man
You try out, you think you deserve to be one the team and you go that day to look at the cut-list
You wake up and you can't even sleep, you're like, ""Damn I'm gon' make the team, I did my thing at tryouts.""
You go to the list. All the niggas is looking at their names on the list, some niggas is like, ""Aww shit I see my name nigga I'm good, I'm good nigga I'm good, I see my name.""
And you're looking for your name, and you kinda play in the back, tryna wait for niggas to clear out cause you're not sure
And you go to the list and your name ain't there
And you're like, ""How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him.""
So a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up
Cause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed
But you know, shit, everything happens for a reason
So shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me, my nigga
So that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know
As I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes
Thank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason. And it couldn't have been with a more fucking, with a better fucking squad
You know the niggas I got on the squad if you listen to this then you might have heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that
Shoutouts to, you know, Mark Pitts, definitely
Shoutout to my nigga Mike Rooney, my nigga E, shoutout to my whole fucking crew, man
That's The Warm Up is about man
RG what's good, Mike Shaw, my nigga Mez, Mez held me down, nigga
More than anybody in the whole fucking, in the whole crew, honestly
So shit, let's get it, man
We got a lotta shit for '09, '010, '011, '0 goddamn 35
That's all I got man, that's The Warm Up
I made the team
So when you go from making the team, now what you gotta do nigga, you gotta start
You gotta be a starter, you gotta make it to college
You gotta make it from college to the league, nigga
Trust me, I ain't get no deal and fucking relax man
I feel like I ain't made it yet period nigga
And that's all I really gotta say yo, it's The Warm Up
Thank you for listening man
Yeah",76906,11467

Bring it on, I'm young and I'm back at it
Exposing these whack cats as fast as a crack addict
This nigga's a savage with nastiest bad habits
Class act, we don't even chat with these rap faggots
Sleepin' in a trap and drink 'til I'm mad ratchet
Breathin' in hashish 'til I feel asthmatic

Game lookin' dry and I apply like chapstick
Suck a fat dick, haters, abolish
I hate to be honest, I even leave my haters astonished
And like a wallet, easy when I reach in my pocket
Y'all speakin' this nonsense
And we don't even need to see when you drop shit
We was in another country 'sleep when you dropped it
Or fuckin' some foreign-ass freak when you dropped it

You niggas is boxed in, you see that we locked in

Murderin', that's my hobby
Don't shoot, you sloppy

Talk while takin' the trash out
I'm deep in the game pussy, nigga you assed out
And I'mma fuck her 'til she passed out in my glass house
I cause ruckus. The fuck is that 'bout?
Who let the mu' fuckin' cats out?
I'm in your neighborhood smokin' wood for the greater good
The greater good is on the greener side
You see where I'm, headed in that direction, a nice selection
Resurrection, after sex erection
If any nigga think they shit premium

Better put me on the cover, undercovers at my home
Tryna catch a nigga slipping, but I'm sticking to the flow
Heard these niggas flipping coke—why the fuck these niggas broke?

Every time my voice comes out my mouth
It sounds like nails on a chalkboard
Savin' pieces shattered as my age increases faster
I can make my thesis matter if i'd learn to fuckin' talk more
But that's just an inkling small talk is always shrinking
In this ship we'll all be sinkin' 'til we fill in all the gaps
I've made some dumb decisions and evaded inhibitions
Diggin' graves for my ambitions just to make it on the map
Which seems ironic it present given my title
Periodically steppin' through this recital i've practiced a thousand times
Messagin' with my idols
Indefinitley soundin' like a dumbass when i try though
I treat a soundcloud page like a diary
And push away all the people who inspire me
Sorry
So afraid of the person i should try to be
And it seems by now they should kinda be
Sorry",19652,33297

Jarring over your charred remains

Unguard your gains
All things obtained are in vein
I am overjoyed to destroy
Boys will be boys
Uncoy deploy noisy toys
Everyday, array of dismay
Dead prey on display
Let the slain lay where they may
Tell 'em how to ban their fellow man
Settle, tell your land
Quell your well in advanced plans
Grace your acquaintances with your complaints
Stated on the page letter
Awaiting the greatest ever
Better late then never
Better you in a crate
One state lesser
One day deader in red shaded decor

Y'all are weak and talk sloppy like Bobby Chacon
Blood shed and war anti-christ the prophecy shown
I tried to tell you that the Bush's were possibly cloned
You should know about distortions of lessons in college
About the water-fuel cell, the suppression of knowledge
I don't call that mother fucking professor a scholar
I call him a profiteering liar obsessed with the dollar
Why we in Iran if all that we want is Osama?
Why we in a jam when all that we want is Obama?

Big shadows, i think i need more sun, big shadows, big shadows

[Verse 1: Omen]
I was a youngin', late bloomer, never had recorded writing raps on my computer
When i was a shorty, uncle Mark he introducethe, legends of this game, to my ears then i grew up
Never thought id be a rapper wanted to be Kobe, wasn't good enough for NBA, that hit me slowly
Meanwhile i was writing all on message boards, nerdy text battles, backpackers i would join
Way before this liquor burned, life took a different turn, i started biting Canibus and using bigger words
Met a couple other kids they nice as hell damn, thought that i was fly, they got me in a tail spin
One of them was named Therapist, thought i was arrogant cause i won competitions that he thought was unmerited
Got a little cooler, had a lot in common, way more than just rhyming, talking how we'd change the climate of this rap game
So i put out 'Do The Right Thing' and that shit ain't do a damn thing
He dropped the come up like a year later, both of us on this journey tryna be some entertainers
Months past then he told me them industry heads was talking
Tryna get more MySpace friends, hoping they'd log in, discover me
But who knew that jay would discover you? swear when i heard, i felt that shit like its my ""W""

Happiness lasted and now I'm living vicarious, that could happen for me, inspiration was my inheritance
I dropped a classic verse on this song called the badness then gave the internet madness on this song called enchanted
I was buzzing,touring i think i fell in love in London with a girl named Claire, but see this world ain't fair
Meanwhile i went from omen to his little homie, you know his protege or whatever they wannna call me
I started getting angry, like damn don't want no more help, my foolish pride, suicide, i put that gun on myself
Metaphorically cause the majority saw me as something that historically is not where i want to be when my story peaks
They call me AZ, i think I'm more like Nas, Lauryn hill but they often treat me like I'm Pras
I think i'm top 5 talent wise, i may not be on TV screens but the camera lies

Boy stop acting like a hoe, there ain't no captain save em
Make it happen by any and all means
It's a million that would love to be in my position had to stop my bitching that's when i unlocked my vision
Elephant eyes adjusting my skies, past wasn't heaven but i had one hell of a time
I been blessed, i had fans scream my name in a crowd all around the world so i had to change up my style
This is just a platform, up to me to transform, do i focus on the rose or just on the black thorns?

Home is where my head is at, that's where the bread is at
But, baby, I can't do this anymore, that's where I left it at
But if you say the word I'll be there with you, for real
Mr. caught up in the moment, we turned down the first deal
And I've been out of touch for a minute

Better bury us with the truth
Ride for the things I gotta prove
Conscious just be conscious
If you let 'em they gon' turn you to a monster
And we gon' have you begging for some freedom
And I'm betting on my people
And we don't give a fuck if it's illegal
We gon' have you running from the reaper

Couple hundred voices, so lethal

The way the world works now, you have to be wealthy in order to live healthy
The way the world works now, you have to pay for knowledge in order to be considered smart
But Ralphi said, ""who teaches those who think outside the box?
Where's the school for those who do not want to go to school?
How do you keep safe those who do not believe in authority?
How does one who is never understood get to ventilate?
How do you fill the void but not know what's missing?
How do the original protect themselves in a world of angry imitation""

Yo, you Bastard, flip the phat track
Here I go, here I go, whether friend, whether foe
Let 'em know that I flow over the rainbow
Hit the deck!
Aw, yep, *ch-ch plow* from the TEC
Takin’ heads, takin’ necks, what the fuck they expect?
I don’t know! I don’t care! I won’t fall, I won’t stare at a ho
’Less I know that I’m goin' to the mo-
T-t-tel, ’cause I’m lousy, my technique is drowsy
Stop tryin’ to foul me, sayin’ that we're lousy
But I’m a tyrant, defiant, walkin’ New York Giant
President of the Wu, but I’m also a client
It’s the Wu, what?!
You knew what? You do what, what! Who, what, what!
I don’t give a flyin' FUCK about a chump
'Cause his heart only pumps Kool-Aid
Snatch a kid by the braids, and cut his head off
[Verse 2: Ol’ Dirty Bastard & RZA]
Rhymes is rugged like burnt buildings in Harlem
The Ol’ Dirty Bastard from the Temple of Shaolin
Dirty to the brain like drops of acid rain
*Clang, clang, clang*, rhymes pluckin’ at your brain
So take a sip from the cup of death
And when you’re shakin' my right hand, I’ll stab you with the left
*Whirr, whirr, whirrr!* Red alert, red alert!
Ason comin’ straight from the dirt
Once I go berserk, mad brothers got hurt
Nothin’ new in '92, it’s time to go to work
Trills, watch 'em scream once I hop on the scene
They fear the return of the Fatal Flying Guillotine
Mr. Milli, that means I’m also militant
Don’t wear no suit and tie, I’m no gentleman
Gettin’ laid, takin’ heads — that’s my hobby
Punch a brother in the face who call me Robbie
I be the RZA, call me that cuz I
Never liked the name I received from my poppa
Dirty deluxe, yo, I’m huntin’ for ducks
Snatchin’ devils up by the hair, then cut his head off

[Chorus: Pooh Shiesty]
Just sit back, see how I play it, Shiesty switched it up a notch
Let the dope cook on the stove, we turn the eye down, watch the pot
1017 'round my chain so I tote the same 'mount of shots
Palm Angels denim huggin' me, pockets keep growin', knots
And I ain't had shit when I got out, had to snake my way to the top
Left two men down, we got 'em shot, blrrd, blrrd, switch out the Glock
Mug around me, get you popped, I treat everybody like opps
We move with flip phones and pagers 'cause them iPhonеs get shit locked
My operation too amazing, I posе 'cause the feds watch

[Verse 1: Pooh Shiesty]
Buy firearms and narcotics, do first-degree boys and robberies
Had these rollin' Backwoods of them dead opps, I had to spark
Double cup filled up with Wocky, that medicine in my body
I signed a deal and went and bought a P, put the vacuum seals in my projects
You wanna order up a hunnid? Sixty bags of 'em was garbage
You know I'm slimy as it get, I got outta here off a noggin'
And no, I can never put up my fire', that's a never, not even probably
Since a youngin', been shit poppin', since Truey joggers and Robins
We backseat nigga for flodgin', leave his head like Dennis Rodman's
When I pop out Richard Mille, bet they say Shiesty the hardest (Shiesty the hardest)
Beside rap I was gettin' rich regardless
I got this shit forever tatted on me, king of of my apartments
Everybody keep on yappin' till them .62 get to sparkin'
Cut the block off, start the traffic
If the cops come through, this Drac' goin' park it
Blrrd, blrrd, big blrrd, blrrd, ayy, blrrd, blrrd

So I stay drippin' on the daily, I know them boy clockin' (Ayy, blrrd)

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Got a .40 on me right now, I ain't never scared (Never scared, you know that)
I'll shoot this bitch up right now 'cause I never cared (Bah)
Gangster to the core with the war like a leather-head
Eyes hurt, they sore 'cause I seen some shit I never said
Thinking about my boy, don't sip Rémy, I just pour it
We got blow outs on the score, we couldn't catch 'em so his brother dead
Bring it to your door, spent a milli', ran up four
Big ol' hammer like I'm Thor 'cause my Cubans cost a hundred grand
Stupid, is you stupid? I got one up, I shoot it (Grrt)
I got bands on a man, rock designer like I loot it

Beam on his head through the scope, it was deadly

Ooh ooh that's him that's him
Young, slim, diamond skin but, my element is wind
Let me begin from the jump where my pops was
He threw me into the lake where them sharks was
That's how I learned how to swim so I swam to the shore
And then I hopped out the water like -
Guilty with blood on my limbs
The glove didn't fit but I tried to pull it over my knuckles
I guess it's rejecting me, it wasn't in my destiny
I got the fake Gucci bag filled with cash, and a glass filled with red water
The closest we got the philosophers stone
The camera on top as it watches my home
And then I saw the 12 walking up to the gate
Ooh bitch that's a mistake don't do that!
For they sake I just hope that they knock and they leave when I don't answer the doorbell
Cause if I gotta try and escape and release the chimera
It ain't gonna go well
Them Xans in my pocket
A hand full of debit cards

...Powdered Water Too Part 1,rap,Eyedea & Abilities,2007,"[Eyedea]
If someone grew up in a cubicle as Plato once suggested
They would only know the cubicle and not the world outside it
And they wouldn't view the cubicle as something geometric
We only know it's a cubicle because we live outside it

Now the one inside the cubicle can't comprehend his measurements
Because measurements are models made up for and by observers
Relative to their position on the outside of the cubicle
To understand objectively so they can study further

If I grew up in a cubicle the walls limit my universe
I have no knowledge of the entirety like the outsiders do
If you follow what I say and can swallow the powdered water
Close your eyes and open your minds, this one's for you

And the brain equals a cubicle we'll never think outside it
Now inside wanna try to tie a diagram to modify them
I'm a man whose a hybrid of a body of a pirate
Of a soul that can fly without control
Realizing the brain takes in six billion signals per second
Most of which are hidden and not given to the senses
We're limited to a few futile primitive tools of perception
Livin' in a universal pool of firsthand deception

The mind's job is to receive the signals
And block out the ones that don't coincide with imprinted symbols
That way the information you obtained is recognized
Reality is thinkable; incomparable to space and time

It makes a map of the territory that gives us
The topic of the Copenhagen interpretation of modern quantum
Physics which states we don't know the meal
We only know the menu that our brains tells us is real

We don't know the rules of our heads
From inside these cubicles we can't see the truth
No one really knows exactly what happens when we think
Therefore we can never really ever know anything

This is the consciousness revolution
You got the right to think
Don't think about it just do it

Pistol beside me, my holy shield

Read a couple psalms up inna the morning early

Could you be so kind and show me a sign

Decent values with a decent wine
Decent jubee running it down the line

Maybe it's the way that I've been spending my time
I'm still searching for a fine peace of mind
Decent jubee running it down the line

So if you is a gal with whole heap of value
What a valuable nice and decent gal you

That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga

My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public (Hahaha)
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
(And [?]) Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah (Excuse me, baby)
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no,) 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row (Yeah)

Coward motherfuckers I despise, when it's time to ride
I was the first to hop inside (Let's go, nigga, let's go,) give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life (Yeah, nigga!)
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama,) come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it (Hahaha)

My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya

Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down wit' it

I paid off half you niggas debts
Yet I don't get my respect

I promise I learned my lesson
This my story, I just hope you get the message
Since I was younger
My hunger told me my future was destined
I treated people like college
Didn't care if I got accepted
I had to pack up my luggage
Budget was tight but I stretched it
You ever believed in something
Even if you couldn't see it
They call it great, I call it faith
I knew with that I could be it
That's why I'm never afraid
That ain't how I was raised
Even if you switch up on me
Know that I'll never change

They thinking I done made it
I showed 'em love
Now niggas feeling like they obligated
I made a choice
If it's stressing me I won't tolerate it
I got tired of waiting
I would think that you'd get tired of hating
This is more than a million viewers
Who think they love me but never met me
But more for those who could see me [?]
And won't forget me
Usually I'm alone
But at home I still got a family
Just praying I win a Grammy
Don't care if you understand me
That could be a blessing and a curse
You think I sound like her
She know I did it first
Don't tell me I'm too high
I'm charging what I'm worth
These niggas wanna eat
But they don't wanna work
I built this shit by myself
I don't need nobody help
Most niggas just wanna kick it
I might just give 'em a belt
You can't take this shit
Cause it's in me
Who said I fell off
Don't tempt me
It's fuck you if you ain't with me
Can't break my heart
Cause it's empty
You niggas thought you could get me

It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
[Verse 3]
The situation that the Base is in
I'm kinda stingy that's why I don't wanna lend
A funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend
But listen up 'cause I want you to comprehend
'Cause I'm the leader, the man superior
I take care of ya and then ya get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes are not counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt to listen to Red Alert
Take off your shirt
Make sure it don't hit the dirt
I like the kids; the guys, the girls
I want the ducats 'cause this is Rob Base's world
I'm on a mission, ya better just listen
To my rhymes 'cause I'm all about dissin'
'Cause

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

[Verse 4]
I stand alone, don't need anyone
'Cause I'm Rob, just came to have fun
Don't need friends that act like foes
'Cause I'm Rob Base, the one who knows
About things that make ya get weary
Don't cheer me, just hear me
Out 'cause I got the clout, shout (Ho!)
Before I turn the party out
I won't stutter
Project my voice, speak clearly
So you can be my choice
On stage or on record
Go to the Wiz and select it
Take it off the rack, if it's wack put it back
I like the Whopper, fuck the Big Mac
If you want static, so let's go
So, throw up your hands
Go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me? No, oh
'Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the back-up
We're not soft, so you better just slack up
'Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze
Rock the mike with the help of EZ
Rock on the set, the music plays
Only cuts the records that I say
[Chorus]
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

All right, now, EZ Rock
Now, when I count to three
I want you to get busy
You ready now?
One, two, three, get loose now

Hope You Dont Mind,rap,360,2011,"[Intro: 360]
I'ma get on my sort of emo shit on this one
Gonna vent a little
I hope you don't mind
Yeah, listen

[Chorus: 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
And can I let it all out?
See, I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (Yo)
Yeah

[Verse 1: 360]
Ayo, I wish I had a time machine
To change the way that my mind perceives everything my eyes have seen
And make me look at life through a wider screen
It ain't what you might believe's happenin' behind the scenes
I treat the beat like an X-ray, press play
Lookin' inside, the best way to express pain
Fuckin' up is becomin' somethin' I'm used to
But sometimes to find yourself you gotta lose you
To those listenin'—sorry for bein' emo
But fuck what the doctor says, this is what I need though
Yeah, and so I'm walkin' into that cloud
Where it has to hurt just to bring you back down
Almost became addicted to the painkillers
'Cause without that feeling, yo, the pain's killer
You'd think having a near death experience'd
Make a smart person take their life more serious
From nearly dyin' to feelin' so enlightened
To nearly cryin' and feelin' only frightened
Releasing this is hard, yo, it fuckin' hurts a bit
It's the only way I know how to come to terms wit' it
And this is Matt here, I'm givin' you the real me
I just hope that you can feel me
[Refrain: 360]
And I know you're pro'bly thinkin' I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

[Chorus: N'fa & 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
Yeah

[Verse 2: 360]
And with the partyin', I think I needa settle down
To be real, I'm getting a little messy now
A few drinks and I'm stressin' out
In another state, looking for my own mum to come and get me out
I got no idea when I'm coming home
And all I want is to be left the fuck alone
I'm only bein' real, the depression comes and goes
Ignore it, 'cause tonight there is yet another show
Lookin' in the mirror like, ""What the fuck am I starin' at?""
Not recognisin' the brutal mess that is starin' back
So I'm givin' you the deepest shit you'll ever hear
So if you got time for Matthew then lend an ear
I'm just hopin' that I've said it clear
If I stay on this path, the end for 360 is gettin' near
[Refrain: 360]
I know you're thinkin' I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

[Chorus: N'fa & 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
Yeah

[Verse 3: 360]
I see my mates like my brothers, yo
I hardly see 'em anymore, the last time was a month ago
They either workin' or gettin' in relationships
I should do that too, but, yo, I hate the shit
Don't get me wrong, yo, I love women
With what I see though, it makes it hard for me to put my trust in 'em
All it takes is one person to fail you
And then you feel like majority will fail too
My insecurities'll swallow me whole
And, when they arise, yo, I'm not in control
They watchin' every move and they move with me
Like, ""Look at that dude, '60, that motherfucker's too skinny""
I can handle friends tellin' me I'm underweight
But, from a stranger, it's something that I fuckin' hate
I know you're unaware that shit's a low blow
But you feel the need to tell me like you think I don't know?
No, that's rude, find a bridge and jump off
And if I tell you to fuck off then fuck off
That's not being immature about it
That's me admittin' I'm insecure about it
And, yo, I'm sorry if I'm seemin' insane
But I wrote this while I was at the peak of the pain
[Refrain: 360]
But now it's got me thinkin' I should keep it to myself
But I can't, yo, I need it 'cause it helps

[Chorus: N'fa & 360]
I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain (I hope you don't mind)
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane (Like I'm goin' insane)
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (Let it all out, yeah)
So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don'ts like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out? (Can I let it all out, yeah)

Fallin,rap,D Smoke,2020,"[Verse 1]
Uh, I still know your old number by heart
310-644, need amor, see? I adored you
Got the same roots, so your tree I explore
Ain't with the law but you're everything I court, get it?
The only girl I'd come and visit
When I got my Ls a nigga was well intentioned
Still virgins, but felt each other some exquisite
My pure purpose was to find out where you're numb and kiss it
Wasn't young and dumb, was more like dumb and gifted
Used to dance I would come to watch you hit the splits
Remember when that nigga put his hands on you at the pool?
You saw another side of me, that was something vicious
He had it coming, from love I wasn't runnin'
I'd fight for it, a life to give, for you I'd buy a dozen
Rose bushes, in hopes that each one would blossom in it's season
That was when I believed in, fallin'

[Chorus]
Heels over head, feet on the ledge (Fallin')
Wheels on the edge, lean over then (Fallin')
Feels like I'm skydivin' shoeless
When did love just become so ruthless?
Heels over head, feet on the ledge (Fallin')
Wheels on the edge, lean over then (Fallin')
Feels like a fight I'm losin'
When did love just become so—
[Verse 2]
The homies in the hood thought study abroad meant anatomy
Like introducing your world to the lower half of me
I guess the irony of it was that we supposed to be lovers
When we signed up, but that was two months 'fore we had to leave
We still traveled, can't throw down no gavel
No judgment, our love ran its course but no Babel
Our tower didn't shoot through the clouds with no shadow
Hung over them, now sober dem
Drink by the pitcher, fuck by the liver, lust for a nigga
Trust ain't a issue, we in Costa Rica so we must be adventurous
In the rainforest with the monkeys, tarantulas
Got they eyes on us, our drank you would take a puff
Broke students, but we made enough
Then I got reckless and neglected you
I wanted my dinner and my breakfast too
I was on my solo shit while you was fallin'

[Chorus]
Heels over head, feet on the ledge (Fallin')
Wheels on the edge, lean over then (Fallin')
Feels like I'm skydivin' shoeless
When did love just become so ruthless?
Heels over head, feet on the ledge (Fallin')
Wheels on the edge, lean over then (Fallin')
Feels like a fight I'm losin'
When did love just become so—
[Verse 3]
Why niggas play that shit like baggage is a female trait?
It's like tellin' a woman that she lyin' when she yells, ""Wait""
And Cole says, ""She don't wanna be saved,"" leave your cake
'Cause once you're in it to win it you may not see your escape
With that said, I can admit it, I play ""Queens"" to fuck with bitches
And through my hurt vision at times I couldn't tell the difference
And through my uncried tears I couldn't smell the flowers
So the power of pussy had niggas on jaded missions
But if it's in his will, might as well Jaden Smith it
If you feelin' the kid maybe we should stay and kick it
We can both enjoy the company, someone who listens
We'll take the bite off of the knife out of my side in stitches
Begin the process of healing, progress is needed
My lesson wasn't learned the first time so that shit was repeated
Everything I gave the universe I'm bound to receive it
Like when I lied and I cheated, wonder where she went, fallin'

[Chorus]
Heels over head, feet on the ledge (Fallin')
Wheels on the edge, lean over then (Fallin')
Feels like I'm skydivin' shoeless
When did love just become so ruthless?
Heels over head, feet on the ledge (Fallin')
Wheels on the edge, lean over then (Fallin')
Feels like a fight I'm losin'
When did love just become so—
[Post-Chorus]
I'm fallin', ooh

Turn it off when Rico starts getting bookie

Yeah man. But Look B, once we get my little brother man we right the fuck back on naby. We right the fuck back on when I get Sonny. It's gonna Be bus...

Ey! Ey! Ey! Ey!
Don't rub on that, you blot that!

Listen, from now on, don't nobody talk to me directly!
You understand?
You got business with me, you talk to Huey!

[Verse 2: Nines]
It might just look like me & Pebz are just sittin' here
But every time my phone rings, I'm closer to a millionaire
Told my nigga: ""don't borrow out his pedal bike.""
I lose weight every time that I sell you light
They saying Prezzy broke like my rollie fell
Connect drops me boxes, we don't own a scale
Couple chicks, I could wife a few hoes as well
Bitch lost her mind If she thinks she's my only girl
They saying I'm materialistic
Like I wasn't dropping lewels, but clearly they missed It
Feds on to me I had to move base
You say you fly birds, but your stacks thinner than a shoe lace
[Outro]
I built a counchline, getting extra bread
So how can trapping be dead, like what Section said?
Money underneath the mattress when I rest my head
So I'm sleeping on P like I wet the bed",11345,48215
Billy Mays vs Ben Franklin,rap,Epic Rap Battles of History,2011,"EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
BEN FRANKLIN!
VS!
BILLY MAYS!
BEGIN!

[Benjamin Franklin]
I'm big Ben Franklin and this shan't be pretty
Let me instruct you how we battle in the city of Philly
You couldn't sell Rick James a bag of crack, you're out of practice
My victory's more certain than death or taxes
Fact is you're a hack, wack QVC joke
You peddle soap that cleans bird shit from my windows
I'll craft a lyrical coffin and then spit the nails in
Call me Arthur Miller son, cause it's death of a salesman

[Billy Mays]
Hi Billy Mays here with a special TV offer
Watch me crush this bald fat foppish founding father
I'll take my awesome auger and sow your quaker oats
I'll shoot your rhymes down like a regiment of red coats
I'm lord of the pitch and leader in home sales
You're just a lumpy pumpkin who invented the mail
Benny's got kite'n key but you're in for a shock
When I strike you with bolts from my lightning rod cock
[Benjamin Franklin]
Stop I protest these intolerable raps
It takes just one easy payment for me to whoop your ass
Cause I'm mint I'm money I'm an educated gentleman
So join or die Bill cause it's all about the Benjamin

[Billy Mays]
But wait there's more!

[Announcer]
Is there anyone out there who can finish this battle?
Anyone...?
Anyone...?

[Vince Offer: The ShamWow Guy]
I can
You following me camera guy? Cause it's about to get furious
You're gonna love my nuts until you're bi-focal-curious
Your boy George chopped down trees; you couldn't break a piece of balsa
Slap chop your face, make a double chin salsa
Your style's so broke they call you Poor Richard
It's bad enough I got to see you every time I tip a stripper
Vince against a founding father is just too bad
Cause after this America is gonna lose a Dad

WHO WON?
WHO'S NEXT?
YOU DECIDE!

I said, ""You're right, your booty's my lifeline""
In my life I try to live with decency
Right here, right now, I wish you were freakin' me
Freak with me frequently, sleep with me and freak some D
And you can see what livin' with a G can be like
You're right, your booty is my lifeline
Your booty is my high life-line

She's like Sig Freud and Roy cause shes taming my cock
She's riding it nonstop

Order up another quatch, nigga that's the top spot
Then I say something like Masultaph

Mama forgive me for all the things that I’ve done
Baba forgive me for all the sins that are fun

But that would result in telling him all the things I’ve done
But the Son will rise and the day will come
When every other man is overshadowed by his throne
And people will chant, praying that the day will never come
That the greatness before them will up n' vanish, dead n' done
And to that I say two things that you would not object
Every soul will taste death and every sun will surely set
To my family, I’m blessed and to the fake people I’ve met
To the years of grinding and all the tears my mother’s wept
The courage and inspiration I’ve gained upon this road
Though the journey seems bleak, know that I’m never alone
Got God on my side, my supporters, my fam

I guess I'll just keep my fucking head up 'til the day I'm finished

California grapes, I'm breaking fine wines
Me I'm sky high, my bitch down to earth
Money in the bank, weed roller in her purse
And I ain't slackin on the job, my dog I been alert
Been gettin cake, bank being the verb
Big numbers on the net so niggas show love
And the diamonds on my neck should make these hoes trust
On the road, at the venue filled with model hoes
College shows, smokin grade a honor roll
Bad broad, light skin, hood niggas, white friends
And I ain't gotta talk much, it's in your face
Give me brain, cause she say she got expensive taste!
Let her rub my tattoos, now she flyin'
Smokin' zig zags too, nigga rap like crack so I

Too Mucking Fuch lets go
Turn off my BB and my HTC
Please don't interrupt me when I'm smoking THC
I'm out to prove, what I'm about to do with this ounce of food (what?)
First class flights, higher altitude
Lead astray by the hash tray
I am half baked
If there's no smoking sign I'mma eat my hash cake
Only with my back up, I'm out to get paid
And I roll my spliffs backwards, the Amsterdam way
Hey, hey!
Got mental health problems, forget it!
I will give you two draws, you will turn schizophrenic
This smell of your police, pull us over for the hell of it
But fine often, cause we smoked out for the evidence

There was big on... then I used to roll spillfs
Get the whole sip, now I'm in the days

Down to the last...

Paint the town red like the soles on the loboutins

Hydroponic (hah!), home grown (hah!) (hah!)
We're playing chronic, this is a smoke zone
Rolling flower power joints, nose cones
If I light this shit up I'm fucking up the ozone

Just a hit make you twitch like smoking on friday
Live your life, that's what I say

You can smell it through my pocket

Anybody feel like rolling up a blunt of kush?
I would, but she got me sleeping, feeling good
Sick of position body stiffer than a brick of wood
That's me feeling like a real nigga should
I'm addicted so consistent lets roll up another
Light green swisha sweet casa loma suites in the d
You know the ones wit the upstairs
When im powered up I devour blunts doing what I gotta do until a mothafucka
Up there, up where in the air you can't come up here
Real players do whatever that they want here...
Moving quicker than jamaicans in the fast lane
I'm babysitting, don't forget to tell em pass mane
Break it down, roll it up

Get in like, I do *the same old thing (x3)*

Cause I hate debt, and I got bills to pay before the day sets
Trying to keep right but I stay left I ain’t checking out
But need a rain check, and my girl wants a brand new get-up
So I guess I gotta buy another outfit
And both kids roll out their own kicks
I stretch money like aerobics, love getting paid but hate paying tax
Love getting laid but hate chasin' ass
You can’t have one without the other, ask a friend
You gotta work it out before you cash it in

V the beat bandit who bring heat for the mic
Unhand it!
Whoever go after burn they hands and lips
A lot of rappers ran and abandoned they whips
It's just another day in the Dunya
Don't leave your girl around V he might swoon her
Up under the window serenade her like a crooner
Stay ahead of the game and cut her off sooner rather later
Use her to gather data
Scoop her in the butter soft moon roof Navigator
Or the Land or the Lex or the Benz
116th by the hour from the Africans
But they won't let you push 'em
One tried to get fly I almost had to mush him
If I wanted to rob him I would have wore a mask
Hit him with the four, took the dough and tore ass
Want not, waste not, front not
They didn't see him dip into the 50 cent blunt spot
V walked the town with space boots, space suits
Fucked up cut but she still say his face cute
Told the streets ""What you staring at?""
The sewer cap opened up and said ""Why you wearing that?""
He said ""Oh you wanna snap, piss-face?
The way you be in everybody business is a disgrace!""
At the park gates ""Hark who goes there?""
""It's V, the MC who's nasty as nose hair""
""You may go"", he said ""You should have been say so!""
Tipped him in cash, an Argentinian Peso
""There you go my good man, buy something nice for the seed""
And please keep it moving twice the speed
Consider that your fair warn
Or else I'll bring it to ya express like Airborne""
Vaughn, drop a turd on the beat
And shout out that little bird from the Word on the Street
He write ""VIK"" in a sick demented handstyle
And go bombing with a chick who whipped the rented van while
All he say is ""You nuts""
He really had enough of poo putts and crew cuts
Soup's on! And I got a coupon
Chinese restaurant, asking for the Grey Poupon
He said ""No! Duck sauce, soy sauce!
And this ain't no Burger King so you don't get no toy, boss""
Uh-oh, it's beer o'clock, I think I'm sober
""How 'bout we think this over over a can of King Cobra"" (Ok)

Or keep his edge up, V-shaped like Mamuwalde

No justice, no peace, in these troubled times like these
I'm down on one knee, and I'm praying for what I need
So whatever's in that dark, is goin' always come to that light
So if you shot him in his back, two wrongs ain't never made it no right
Tried to test my strength, and I fought with all my might
Took a page out of this chapter, just to reconcile my life
We hate that Lucious goin' through it, we know that he ain't do it
(Heartbeat)
Let's change for the better, make the world a better place
United as a people, be the winners of the race
And never kill the Joker, cause he used to be a Ace
It's things outta' life, that you just can't replace
Like the sketches to the drawing, that the pencil couldn't trace

Lay Down Your Weapons,rap,K Koke,2013,"[Hook: Rita Ora]
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me, if that means anything
Can we avoid war, search and destroy war
Learn what to live for if that means anything
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me if that means anything

[Verse 1: K Koke]
Listen little man I done told you fuck the hype ting
I done told you road life ain’t what it might seem
Where I’m from we do wrong for the right green
But at a price could loose your life for some nice things
No nice dreams just fiends and sirens
No lie you don’t wanna hear the nine scream
These cold nights got us slipping like an ice rink
My bro died he got hit up like lightening
My road darg kill him
He’s in prison with the lifers
Youngin’ listen can you vision where my mind is
This life’s sick the ends sort of like the wire
Friends turn snitch I know you heard about spider
I recommend you take a telling from me
Cause I been in it from the start darg, its hell in these streets
Once you’re in it then you’re in it ain’t no settling beef
Lay down your weapons, fuck repping
Get your money and leave
[Hook: Rita Ora]
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me, if that means anything
Can we avoid war, search and destroy war
Learn what to live for if that means anything
Lay down your weapons, weapons for me if that means anything

[Verse 2: K Koke]
You think this life looks fun?
Well look a little closer
You just might find this life isn’t what you hoped for
Road sides a lie and the proof is in the culture
The truth is you die or sit down no sofa
Prison living is an image you don’t know darg
Picture living in this prison and it’s so dark
And when you listen you hear whispers from the cold draft
Looking in the mirror at a sinner with a broke heart
I know it’s so hard, I hope it won’t last
I know you’re scarred and you just wanna get your doe fast
But you don’t wanna end up dead or stuck behind bars
Time is of the essence and the present flies past
When the nine sparks mothers lose their baby boys
The die hard kids wanna play with toys
Listen to my voice can you hear my pain?
Before there isn’t choice

Turn my mic up
Yeah, Yeah
Check it out
(Ugh)

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Y'all niggas know who be the waviest
Fuck y'all niggas up again just like Giants did the Patriots
Everybody know I be the craziest, but it down sicker than a crazy bitch
Y'all niggas don't want no problems, boy, you don't really really want to play with this
Bussa Bus, M.I.A, when I'm in the building, niggas get to M.I.A
I get their women playing with some other women, then they get to looking at a nigga as if ""Am I Gay?""
""Yes you is, shorty""; then I stay, partying with little mami bend okay
You want to enjoy a little when I play, fuck it up and cause a little anarchy
Shhh, hold up, mami wait a minute, I know you love it when I call
Black boy, I'm in the place, look here, know you love it when I ball
Know I'm winning here around this bitch, got my hand up on the turn-on switch
Life is good every day and I'm rich, YMCMB, Conglomerate

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio
[Refrain: M.I.A.]
Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screaming if I blow you with a bang
Ah

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
It's getting hot in this bitch, hhorty, please hold my jacket
Funny how baby girl well, bad girl come, hold my ratchet
Give me that back, can't play with it, I'mma finish everything and put them all in a casket
Finished with the club, take shorty back to the crib, when I'm done with her, she'll be calling me ""bastard""
Now let me give you the magic, y'all niggas must like getting your ass kicked
You think you're playing with fire? Nah nigga, y'all playing with acid
Face it, see the spaceship just landed, got a nigga wilding like Animal Planet
You don't want a violation—it's a hazard, y'all still struggling to meet the standard
See, this shit is a habit, attract bad bitches like I'm really a magnet
Wack niggas, instead of swallowing a pill, y'all niggas really need to swallow a tablet
Until they really come get me, shut shit down, never go against me
Y'all already know a nigga gotta move with a bad girl, shorty ride shotgun with me

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young, bad girls do it well
Chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest when I'm banging on the radio

Machine, baby

[Verse 1: Conway the Machine]
Look
Word to the coke that in my shooter nose (Sniff)
Beluga 2.0s in the coupe I drove
On the stoop in the cold movin' stupid O's
Whip the fish before it even dried, deuce was sold
Take a half, produce a whole when I use the stove
Went from trappin' in Pelle jackets to rockin' Gucci clothes
That's why when you see me I'm with a group of hoes
Bad bitches that look like Karrueche, I'm used to those
Bal Harbor shoppin', my pockets do be swole
Cuban's gold
Put my knife in your body, remove your soul
Use your homie shirt to wipe my knife off
His blood splattered on my Kith Moncler, I stabbed him twice more
The fuck I'm takin' your advice for?
When they cut mama lights off, I started sellin' white soft
It's ironic the nigga they tried to write off was takin' the league by storm, I'm kinda like Moss
Wake up in the mornin' to a blunted sour
Then I'm up in lust, I'm makin' money shower
You got money and respect, then you got fuckin' power
I'm rich but I clap a nigga over a hundred dollars
[Verse 2: Styles P]
Where I'm from, you keep the hammer tucked
Niggas is foul, fuck around and get your nana bucked
Grimy niggas'll stick Santa up
Kill Rudolph, then eat 'em, you couldn't manage us
Why you think niggas is comatose?
Homie gave the other homie mama bag, now he got mad
Gotta kill 'em with the mag 'cause she overdosed
If I gotta box, it's the 52 or the rope-a-dope
Stuntin' in the drop
Plottin' on the lot I could build on
Cross me I'ma rock a nigga knot
I ain't thinkin' like your average nigga
I got carats off of carrots sellin' juice
Peaceful yet a savage nigga
You could lie about them Cartel ties
Well I'm the type of guy to leave the Cartel tied
Get the match and the gas, watch the Cartel die
I'll catch 'em slippin' in the gym and let a barbell fly
Break his face with a plate like the ghost did Charlie Murphy
But I'm the real ghost, you ain't no Charlie Murphy
Not in the comedic way
I'm the one who make Paul and Peter pay
9 millimeter spray

[Verse 3: Benny the Butcher]
What you know about the trap bein' slow 'cause the grams bad?
But the plug want his dough so you pay for your man half (I'll take care of that)
.44 Bulldog makin' your pants sag
I swim the swamp with a gator, I made it a handbag
They tell me I'm how hope look
Them pots had to slow cook
Stack of paper on my kitchen table look like notebooks
Two shooters with you? We know them niggas, they both puss
Roll through and I let this toast cook like Rosewood
Black Soprano family, I probably should make the movie
Pray over a brick while I'm slidin' a razor through 'em
Back to back trips now I got my bitch draped in Lou
I'm known for rock and a guitar like David Bowie
Yeah, I went against the FBI and crooked judges
When rappers start losin' limbs you know the Butcher comin'
Y'all still gassed off my rookie numbers
This the kid that's from a block that did Westside Gunn hoodie numbers
Uh, I grew to be a hustler but I ran with thieves (But I ran with thieves)
You steal from the gang, I bet your hands'll bleed
I met in a plug in the feds who used to hand me ki's
We was like Donovan McNabb and Andy Reid
Take me to your trap, I really autograph the plate
I fuck around and put my signature on a bag of H
Y'all niggas usin' 12 12's and call it stackin' cake
When my niggas bag up, we usin' garbage bags and tape
Let's go, agh",4405,85853

My exes and friends weren't moving correct so I cut them off
A lot of you don't like me and I don't like you, so that's no love lost
It's use or get used out 'ere, and me I get used 'cause I'm useful
You get used less 'cause you're useless, it's an ugly game, but it's beautiful
Boy, if you ain't go no dough then pick up your phone and do some shots
Girl, if you've got no arse then you better go gym and do some squats
Small batty gyal in my DM, that's a instant decline, every ting lock 'arff
Pull up on me and my section, instant gunshot, every ting lock 'arff

[Verse 1: Morrisson]
Look at who just stepped in Morrisson
I've already bodied this track, right now it's a burial ting
I'm about to murder this rap game, just like I murdered the trap
I'm a rapper that'd kick off your door and have your crop in the air like Shmurda's hat
Free Bobby, we get a brick, we slap it, bag it and get it all sold
Let's talk green 'cause I get it in bulk, I'm the biggest green man since Incredible Hulk
If bro's got beef then I'm getting involved, kick down front doors and take them down
Put you up for your bags and boxes, then watch your blood turn my blade brown
[Verse 2: Bandokay]
Small batty gyal in my DM, catty, no, she ain't making me happy
Trigger finger slappy, no yard shop when we're looking for pattys, akhi
Lean out of that back seat gladly, jump out gang, jump out and just slappy
The opp boys can't mad me, feds can't stand me just 'cause I look like my daddy
Mad ting when I'm angry, man's angry, the feds locked down half of my family
This sweet one's tryna go on boujee, looking boujee, tryna go on anti
Yo miss, you look sweet, no candy, I like big guns, shotgun just handy
Bad B's tryna off her panty, keep her drawers on, I can't wait 'till my gang see

[Verse 3: Double Lz]
Small batty gyal get lock 'arff, dotty get chop off, ride out proper
Bells for the shotgun but if a colour don't lack on your strip, catch corn in your upper
Fuck off, fuck off, dance get lock 'arff, twist this blade, push that in a sucker
Six in this spin, two in a brucker, them man disperse when we buck each other
Double Lz, I'm a sav', man's anti, slappy, four black yutes in ballys
Clappy, saucy driller in the back seat, athlete, catch up quick, it gets splashy
Slap the dots at your akhi, gladly, stuff the mash with two batteries
Free SJ, my bro's not a patty, we had two waps in the dinger, no cabby

[Verse 4: Burner]
Nuttin' but drills when they're mentioning me, how many drills have I done in a week?
Gang pull up, bare tape at the scene, how many souls am I taking with me?
Pull up, I drill and I'm out, opps over there, I'm shelling that crowd
Marvelous works, I didn't see trial, I'm getting bagged cah their fucking mouths
I'm tryna leave the opp block tented man, would've thought my opps went camping
Come like N Dubz with no regrets, any opp I got, I meant it
Fuck the judge and free all my guys, free all my guys dem sentenced
Heard he got hit with a chesty ones, gonna need more than Lemsip
Juggin' and drillin', belt hold two, it's spinning
Any type of beef, man winning, jeans and the crep, many tings just spinning
Crème to the crème , courtesy of whipping, my mum should've named me Kipling
Man down if I got the 4s on point, bought me the kways from the shelf, that's dipping
Bad B cattin' for the woodin'
She asked if the stories are true, I tell them that the proof's in the puddin'
Shoe box without no shoe, two feet in, man they got one foot in
Eliminate risk, no clues, ride with the Rambz but I might just whoosh him
Corn from the 10 so fat they took him
[Verse 5: V9]
Ayy, come here
Uplift him, when I rip it
They don't wanna feel this drilling (They don't)
Two Samurai's and kitchen, I mean Rambo knife, I'm just kidding
Dot-dot ain't missing, full stop to your life if I ping it
See red like a BBM message, grab that dots and fill him with pellets
I'm lurking
They don't wanna see me purging
Catch these yutes and hurt them, your old ones are wet, close the curtains
Touch my young boy in his head, and awaken him like Krillin
This car holds seven, but we stuff nine
You know we ain't good at maths, opp block, conquer and attack
Mad on my ones, don't need my batch, swing my Johnny and watch him plank
Ching mans neck and call him Titan, backroad drillings, do it in silence
I want man packed like parties, evacuate, keep it marching
V9 too devlish, slap man's sister for loving her brother
I'm on beef and dough like pie, don't think twice, you might die
Slap shots, stop squinting your eyes, you might just dead up tonight
Bill up a zeggy and get fried

[Verse 6: Snap Capone]
Get a whole brick, turn it to two, abracadabra
Score goals like Zaha, been on the field like Drogba
Still try and dodge me a copper
Still doing burger and lobster
You can tell I'm a G from my posture
The .44 long holds crayons
Rose gold bullets with your name on
Shoot-shoot-shoot 'till your brain's gone
Slap off the war with a K on
I don't turn off, I stay on
Might just put your bae on
You get a new pack, I'll buss you, you couldn't even tell it's been touched
I killed two niggas and shot twenty niggas and still ain't been touched
Excellent finish, clinical headshots
Feds caught night gloves, see red in my eyes like Cyclops
If I bang on your whip, that's a write off
If I ride to your block, that's a life lost
.44 long, oh my gosh
Trappin' ain't dead, my Encro buzzing, got bricks on lease
Me and Morrisson, two rap niggas that really put bricks on the streets
[Chorus: Morrisson]
My ex and some friends weren't moving correct so I cut them off
A lot of you don't like me and I don't like you, so that's no love lost

Sober Up,rap,Joe Budden,2010,"[Intro: Joe Budden - talking]
High on life (Joey)
J. Cardim, what up
Parks, what up
Dolla, what up
I think we got one with this one baby
Not really, I hate when niggas say shit like that (Joey)
Quick question though
Y'all in that mood yet?
Naw, naw they ain't hear me
(I said), y'all in that mood yet?

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I broke down a while ago, finally picking up the pieces
Memoirs on how the undefeated, can feel depleted
I don't talk to God as a matter of fact I plead with
At times I hate my reflection and others I'm conceited
Half the time I'm arrogant, other times I'm vengeful
At times it's to convince me, at times it's to convince you
Done a lot of wrong but I ain't never felt resentful
It's been so many times, I lost track of who to repent to
Half the time I'm in the cut, don't want you to notice me
Grow with me and you'll see that I'm only awkward socially
Half the time I'm spiteful, double barrel rifle
I owe so many payback, I feel like I got a right to
So if you need a case in point, you can refer to Budden
And it'll prove the painkillers never murdered nothin
All it did was make me succumb, put ice in me, make me numb
When I revisit the places it takes me from, I'm sprung
[Hook: Joe Budden]
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride
(I don't wanna sober up)
See with me the rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Tell me if you wanna ride or die
La la la la la la la la

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Listen up as a sinner reports, my inner thoughts like an inner war
Headaches act as a tremblin force on my mental ward
Mental's distraught, every word from this sinister boss
Is brought to you by the people like your minister's Porsche
Tight ropin on dental floss, before the haters begin to get lost
Coke and weed got my temperament off
But why would my temper get lost, when as soon as the temperature frost
I'm probably havin intercourse in a resort
Criminal report, pricey condos at a minimal cost
My train of thought ain't as simple as yours
So if our paths happen to incidentally cross
I pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws (ta ha)
Until then let's let the bass kick
Take a shot straight, I don't see a need to chase it
Tryin to fight the urge 'til there's somethin to replace it
I welcome y'all to be my co-pilots on this spaceship
[Hook: Joe Budden]
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride

Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me

Tell me if you wanna ride or die

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Yo, me and the gang would get so blunted
We'd order take out from the Chinese stores
Say make sure you bring change for a hundred, rob him, safety on the metal's off
Figured if we beat the brakes off him
Then how the fuck was he gonna pedal off?
Some live and die by the high, I was born by it
Since Pop gave my mom the needle like go on, try it
Got me feeling like ain't a nigga could harm me
So I go and scoop a mami that wanna come join the army
She was so militant, disciplined, diligent
So I whispered to her ""bet you wouldn't mind chillin"" and
I got to know her on my sofa
I gave her my honorable discharge and she took it like a soldier
See she the type you gotta watch when she come around
Really she only get high, so she can come down
Lost her when I said she ain't gotta settle
Once you start ahead in life, you'll be on the same level, I bet you
[Hook: Joe Budden]

When I was five, this what my father said
""I should have pulled you out and left you on your mama's water bed""
You ask me, my papa's dead
Alcoholic genes from him since a toddler bottle fed
Put me in your stainless, I'm brainless, I'm a hollow head
(My life was the craziest), surprised I'm even walkin
Can you blame me if I'm (atheist)? But I ain't Stephen Hawkins
I know God is in my (radius), I can see him often
In the face of an innocent baby but not when preacher's talkin (come on)
My people sleep in coffins, I miss 'em, I'm breakin down
In the face of a bad bitch that I'm 'posed to be takin down

Cause my pain is Poseidon or a giant Leviathan that I'm hidin from the world)
They hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
How ironic, same place I vomit when I liquor drink
Apparently I need to get a shrink
How can therapy take care of me when I don't give a fuck what niggas think?

You smell it as soon as you get in my ride

See with me the rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life

Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me

I like it done right, when a girl wants to knock me

Don't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit
The judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link
Contended her to meet me at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fuckin' and we only met last week
We were both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
And it reeks on the sheet, girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie 'em and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go
[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh
(Yeah) Oh, oh (Wolf Gang)
(Wolf Haley) Oh, ohh (How you doin'?)
(All good?) Oh, oh (Cool)
(We cool?) Oh, ohh (I'm upset)

[Verse 2]
Bitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip
Make her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon
Busting Ottoman cannons, on the pill
Is he real? Gaza stripping (In my living room)
Wolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms (Mushrooms)
I'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon
This fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating

[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh

(Frankie, Frankie)
Now I'd like to take this time of day
To thank the Mother Earth (Thank you Momma, thank you Momma, fish!)
Letting the sun shine down on the lake
While I fish your waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)
'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool
He on the loose, yeah (Yeah)

[Outro]
Got to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait
Wait 'til you see the semen swimming
Baby, please not half, the whole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion
Makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can’t get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you
You’re fucking wet, fish
[Part 2: Boppin' Bitch]

[Chorus]
So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin'

[Verse 1]
This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she’s a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more Dora-looking sluts let me explore
Until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

[Chorus]
Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch (That's right), she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'

[Verse 2]
This little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn’t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

[Interlude]
Now, now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we can’t fuck with this bitch, y'all? (That bitch she boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')

[Chorus]
Now I'm at a fuckin' clinic
'Cause my dick is swollen and keeps itchin'
Nigga, I'ma kill this bitch (She's a boppin' bitch)
Bitch (She a boppin' bitch)
She a boppin' bitch

[Outro]
Where's my gun? (She boppin') I'ma kill this bitch
Why am I gon' kill this bitch?
To all my niggas out there listenin', that bitch (She's boppin')
And don't let her suck your dick or you'll get hurt",336901,2757

It's not just a job, it's an adventure
If worse comes to worse, I've got your thirst quencher
But ya gotta buy it, don't even try it
I don't rhyme for free, no matter how dry it gets
I collect my money in sets
One before the show and again when I jet
So I get mine, and I'm a get more
'Cause I'm financially secure and I'm sure
So I don't need your tips or advice
'Cause I'm too nice for that, you rat
I can't stand mice, I'm like a cat, kinda frisky
Battling is risky business
You might acquire dizziness, just like whisky
Isn't this enough?
Oh, you think you're tough, cookie
I think you better call your bookie
'Cause you can bet your life, I'm gonna play you like hooky

Don't blame us for nothin'

Skin your teeth and it's your beef that I'll grind
Like a butcher, I'll put you on a table
And let my D.J. cut ya
But you're such a little sucker
I might not even touch ya
I betcha whatcha want is just attention
Your mother and your father shoulda used some prevention
Look at all the time and the money they spent

Dope sold on the cut make our hands bleed
Fuck broke it ain't an option, penitentiary
Or the grave is the only way we fall back
Do our time A.T.W then crawl back
To them streets where we come from taught life
Look alive know niggas better walk right
Real with it quick trigger finger gun play
I only know how to deal with these niggas one way
And someday I swear to God I'mma change that
But I can't cause them evil demons came back
And when I'm high y'all I can't explain
What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
Cause mane I've been a loyal dude and you can trust that
But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
I need to talk but there ain't no one to listen
Lost inside a mental exorcism
And wishing

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

I woke up from a dream feeling all good
Prayed for better days ahead but what was yall doing
Lost, stuck in a stand still waiting for a hand out
Hustling for tennis shoe paper never panned out

Cause shes only 17 and shes already pregnant
Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
Bg's is tripping ain't nothing left to stop them
Uncle in jail daddy dead and their mamma's
Can't teach them how to be men; grow up being followers
The streets swallow them then life overpower them
Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
Crash tested a dummy high volume
Only God can judge but y'all niggas is comical
90 percent of our future's off in prison
Prescription for my mental exorcism
And listen

[Hook]
Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

[Verse 3]
Another kid killed in cold blood a mothers heart broke
Family crying on the first few my heart spoke
Hurtful words I would never dare speak
In the house of the lord still I'm in the devils reach
I don't wanna hear the preacher preach that shit a lie
Plus he knowing how that evil be, but who am I
To judge a man when I see him try
FOX news tried to justify him
And ain't no way that you can clarify
In cold blood our lil homies dying
Another sign of the times but it's terrifying
That you could kill us off have us outlined in chalk
Get arrested go to jail go to court and get the fuck off
That shit is fucked off we worried about the money lost
While the clans about to light another cross
I ain't denying it I speak from intuition
It's also from my mental exorcism
And wisdom
[Hook]
Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud",14464,41184

Once you've found the right doctor
And have told him or her about your pain
Don't, don't be afraid to take what they give you
Often, it will be an opioid medication
Some patients may be afraid of taking opioids
Because they're percieved as too strong or addictive
But that is far from actual fact

Actually become addicted

Write precise to get a pussy nigga tooth chipped

Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now

So many girls, they want the licky hicky dicky
Started getting messages about my releases
Seems to me like my shit is sweet like Rieses pieces
I was so confused, demotivated, sad and scared
Now fuck with me bitch, uh yeah you know I’m up here
I knew I had skill and rapping was still in my will
Homies calm down, you know just take little chill pill
Man, I’m only getting this, and just made a sandwich
Got the meat and lettuce, you just call me annoying
I’m boying, playing around with the mic toying
Man you folks are too dumb, sitting sucking on the thumb
I’m only spitting truth, Em, Logic, Hopsin and Cole
These are my damn idols; I’m no fucking senior
That’s called being humble, that a lot of you lacking
Keep it cool, flow and rhyme, bringing real hip Hop back n’
I got balls, so I keep my words in my sack
Having fun, keep it true for the worth of my daps
You can turn around, cause no way, I’m going down
Or at least as something you can’t even be when
You see me doing shit that’s envisioned and missioned
So keep listening cause I’m not dissing just spitting
True feelings about some of the people I’ve dealt with
That I can’t fuck with, and that I don’t get along with
It’s been long since a song dropped; it feels like I’ve popped
[Verse 2]
I want to rep a city; make people proud of me
So my people can keep their heads high, proud and happy
Just to be loved by motherfuckers, I don’t want to be fake
I rather be real and just fucking deal with all the hate
Cause that’s how 90% of people pay their rent
Really, I’m giving back and getting back what I spent
I ain’t greedy, their just needy, so they ask for more
Get caught in between and I would love to slam the door
No fan base and yet my tracks are still up in your face
Got a view, so confused, you don’t know where each is placed
Getting better, got this flowing, you look so amazed
Are you cool homie? Man, you look so fucking out dazed
My phone is ringing cause I think hip hop is calling
Man Imma be the 1 amongst the homies Balling
Can't leave em’ there, bring em up to stare, put your ear hear
Cause I’m in a mode that no one wants to see in store
But before, I go; I have to give you some more
Cause I got way fucking more left in this breath
That I feel and know is about to go to deep depths
And I’m not talking about your bank account ha-ha
Tanned women all up on me, and feel like no body
I just always wanted that dorm room I could use to
Get drunk and fuck girls from my uni in such as you
I was busy working out the fucking union
What it do, when I is a better team unlike you
Got to be kidding, rather have a girl who is real
Call her a girl, not bitch and yeah man that’s so ideal
Don't disrespect, don't want to get disrespected
Doing shit that I hope you know is least expected
I work to get money like getting all these sane views
Man all this fake music is like poison to my ears
This fucking shit just makes me feel out of place with fears
And it scares me unlike my enemies, man just please
People want some shit they can sit back, relate to
And lyrics that’s true, something I feel is not you
Fuck the money and the house, the girls and the cars
Keep it real and helping others makes you a star
Not the money in your accounts and the biggest house
That’s all small in the real world like a mouse
You can meet up with your homies, talk about my death
Sit, watch, laugh cause doing this till my last breath
I’ve been there now and back, laying killer bars breath free
Doing this every day man, for who I want to be
Don’t give a fuck about what and how you feel and see
Imma come one day and knock, set your ass freeeeee",6285,69945

Where I was growing up
They called coroner
Around the corner
Every morning
Where the fuck Tom Joyner?
No fair, it ain't fair how
The murder rate
Fermanate Ferguson out to Fairground
Shit made me wanna
Sell my soul through the music
Put the streams on water
Ancestors on my head
My uncle my barber
Blood suckas want my bread
So I ordered the garlic
Hustled too hard, these blessings ain't yours
So when I
Pull up and park it, my front seat a toilet
Shit of
Course I'm a target, they hope I get martyred
Lose ya
Corpse in a corporation
Ten years of cooperation
Been wanting to throw bows at Becky
Been wanting to throw jabs at Jason
Gotdamn need a long vacation
Bong rip and a bad bitch
Thick fine with them dimples on it
Love how it shake when it's that thick
Lil' seminar on the simmer down
Feel a lil' more ambitious now
Never doubt what you dream about
Never fear what you feelin' now

Even when you knew my truths
Even when you knew my mistakes
Said you loved me anyway
Said you loved me anyway
Oh Lord, gimme a sign
Show me a way

And you were s'posed to be there for me in the
Long run
What have you done?

[Verse 2: Smino]
Where I was growing up
Stanley and Marlon
Did it big on the corner, every morning
Had etc on 'em
Encountered a jump out
Them boys undercover
To fuck us it all made sense now
Shit made me wanna
Tippy toe when I'm moving
Pray I don't get bothered
Cut my hair low for the gig
Can't nap on the guala
Only way they let me in
Was speaking so very proper
But fuck that, no it don't stop here
I knock the sign over speeding
Traits of the greatest, I'm balling
Tracy McGrady
I swear I, hate police, hate them
Nah nigga, they don't wanna see me shine
Straight to the paper regardless
Bitch we ballin'
Not a slave to the fear
Anymore, I won't allow it
Watchin' tapes of these kids gettin' killed
Lookin' like me
Cut that shit off
They can't desensitize me
I realized that in clusters they can't touch us
I've been tusslin' with my brothers and my sisters about lovin'
'Cause this country don't love us
It ain't for us, mane, fuck 'em

And you were s'posed to be there for me in the
Long run
What have you done?

[Outro: Via Rosa]
Don't give me no
Give me no reason to doubt you

Living my life without you

Long run

Just a Man,rap,Logic,2013,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is my vision
Written without second thought or revision
The type of shit that affect you like an oncoming collision
That just make you freeze, drop to your knees and beg 'em
Please Lord, forgive me for gripping a semi now
When searching for God all I ever do is stare up
While Satan sending me women
Wearing nothing but they hair up
Got the condom on the dresser, I can't wait to undress her
Would you think lesser of me if I did it?
Cause I get lonely, I'm human, and boy it's been a minute
Fresh out the states, surrounded by women that wanna hit it
But should I take the pussy just cause I could get it?
Or do I want something that's more committed?
God damn, it's hard to admit it
As you focus on the little things, the bigger ones will get you
So I minimize the negatives to see the bigger picture
I get richer while you fuckers hate
So keep it up and watch a young brother elevate
I'm black and white but racism I still cannot evade
I never understood the concept, even to this day
You know we're all the same in the eyes of a blade
Because when men shed blood it's still the same shade
[Hook]
That's why I'm just a man homie
Flesh and blood, I'm just a man
But I don't think they understand homie
I ain't perfect, I'm just a man
Yeah, y'all think I'm more than just a man

[Verse 2]
I contemplate on the daily if I'll survive and strive
To be the greatest lyricist dead or alive, I gotta prevail
That's my word like excel
Went from a small town in West Deer Park to XXL
Now we shopping at Louis V, back in the day it was Ross
They calling me the savior, hope they don't give me the cross
Now that's the realest shit you ever heard
Never in the streets but I was closer than the curb
Do you feel me?—Whole world wanna kill me
Signed a deal but I'm still me—in five years will I still be?
Ever since I was a youngin this is all I've ever wanted
Always kept it real while they perpetrated and fronted
I was in the studio while they was gettin' blunted
Always have my doubts but deep down I knew I'd run it
Sportin' Armani like menage a trois that's double breasted
A lot of time I've invested and never once have I rested
Feeling nervous like when you getting tested
The game is over saturated, completely infested
The greatest story ever told, realest song ever written
To hell with a Plan B, motherfucker I ain't kiddin
I''m just trying to get this money, I'm just trying to get paid
That's the type of mentality put careers in the grave
Fuck how much you made
What's it worth if your memory fade?
Now I ain't perfect, on occasion I'm strayed
It's been forever since I prayed and I guess today is the day
So I step in the booth and treat that shit like a confessional
Thinking back as I reminisce
Wondering; does God even exist?
A man of faith but mentally I feel at risk
What you want from me, where am I supposed to go?
Seems like you never talk, tell me how I'm supposed to know?
I'm just a man, I ain't perfect—is this life even worth it?
It's time to dig up the past so fuck it let's unearth it
Like my childhood, living free like a child should
Remember the time I opened the bedroom door crack?
And saw my daddy smoking more crack?
No food in my house, we just couldn't afford that
Momma drinking, sleeping until five
But she always seemed to get up whenever men arrived
Feeling alone at like eleven
Segregated from the other kids like it was 1957
I've loved, I've hated, I've cried, I've died inside
I've resurrected but don't neglect that I've modified
I'm stronger, faster, better than ever before
And everything I've been through can honestly assure
I'm no less, no more
[Hook]
That's why I'm just a man homie
Flesh and blood, I'm just a man
But I don't think they understand homie
I ain't perfect, I'm just a man
Y'all think I'm more than just a man",75071,11700

Here's a tab of acid for your ear
You're the plastic, I'm the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan's Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I'm drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I'm the Don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I'm a kamikaze and I'm a kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non-kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the nine in all blue, yelling, ""I'm a neutral""
But I'ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I'ma fuckin animorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele & Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hands, son, breaking walls like Samson
But I'ma throw a tantrum 'til I'm on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighters up 'til life is up and light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it's nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.44's for 15, yeah my nigga, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies though, choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man

To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, nigga
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, now, now, now

To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, igh
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down, down, down

Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
Ain't no questions hit it vividly and pass me
Don't answer about your problems
Or your issues or your Ashleys
It's a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's
Cinnamon tone women and feminines getting intimate
All broads is frivolous, homies could get they dividends

Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger affiliate
Sick twisted prick, sick sadistic

Burned too many brain cells down, sing it with me

Burned too many brain cells down, no, no

Remember me, I'm the nigga you killed
I was the one dealing with shit you had feeled
I was the one willing to give you a shield
And ride shotgun gripping on a pistol for real
From the beginning considered as a kid who was ill
Saw you in the mirror, the image is vivid I feel
My mind's spinning like a pinwheel, consider it still
Then back then you really even were pinning the wheel
As a little one moving city to city would kill
Any dream, plenty things that a kid wanna steal
Had a couple of siblings but the middle one feel neglected
I bet that all of your feelings concealed
Hella depression and trust schizophrenia's real
Started witnessing murder homie and it was a deal
Couldn't take it anymore, told you nigga to chill
But you were gripping the steel like fuck it give me some pills
Gave up on us homie, you ended it still
As I reminisce about it dawg, it's giving me chills
I watched you cough up a whole blood river for real
And said fuck all the shit that we built, real nigga revealed
As I hover over you in the bathroom like you had to
This isn't real, I sent a message to God hoping he willing to still
Give my old self a chance, what I'm feeling is ill
Ay, remember me still?

Could you try to find your light
Let me give you this advice
Remember me tonight

[Verse 2: King Iso]
Yeah, motherfucker I remember you
You told me that you hated me for stuff that I did to you
Sucker want to punish me enough for what I didn't do
That's why I wanna grab a gun and bust a shot up into you
I was in a mental ward and stuck inside a pickle suit
Everyday bologna sandwich coming out in different food
And if I can't control what happens jumping out my physical
Then honestly I couldn't give a fuck about an interview
Gin and juice, 'bout to take a double shot of Henny too
Pop a pill, intensifying, that's what all the liquor do
Anywho, why would anybody wanna pity you?
Anything that people did to me them niggas did to you
Introverted, sitting in the living room in the nude
You ain't put nothing on, lights nor tennis shoes
There could be an earthquake, whether it gon' mend it to
And everybody wildin', I could guarantee you didn't move
Death couldn't stiffen you, yes we got different views
True colors, true brother, have better pick of you
I was holding on but you left me with shit to do
That you were supposed to and yes I was pissed at you
Daddy came back right, blessed like a fricken fool
Life comin', goin' like death playing peek-a-boo
All in balance like we're testing some chemicals
Since 26 I feel like I'll be dead before I'm 52
Guess that I'm the nigga all the children wanna listen to
I be thinking 'bout 'em everytime a nigga hit the booth
This is dedicated to the ones that ain't got shit to lose
Gotta learn to separate your mind and feelings into two
Look into the mirror, say you're sorry for the shit you do
Learn how to love yourself for real whatever's killing you
'Cause I was once there, about to die but I forgive me too
'Cause in the end your biggest and worst enemy my nigga's you

I know that you living your life
Searching for a reason to survive
Remember, remember me
Remember how we could be
I know it's not easy, could you try
Could you try to find your light

Black Axl Rose, move halves and wholes (Right)
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov (Right)
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears (Oh)
Work pots and pans just to cop me some Airs (Goddammit)
My uncle died, my daddy did too (Ayy)
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
My nephew gone, my heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born
My faith in God, every day is hard
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard
[Verse 2: Kanye West & Jay-Z]
Why I pray so hard, this is crazy, God
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
So que será (Welcome to the jungle), get a case of Syrah

My dreams is big, reality set in (Huh)
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon (Yeah)
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5 (Ooh, woo)
I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin'
I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending (Yeah)
Where the fuck is the sun? It's been a while
Mama, look at your son, what happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
Goddamn, I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the pres'?
Either they know or don't care, I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public, just lying to judges
Riskin' my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it, well

Dear baby you the picture of perfection
Straight from your million dollar smile
To my attraction to your complexion
No hesitation needed; you got me
Inhalin' the aroma of your perfume, and feelin' heated
I move closer to drop the lines of my introduction
Hold out my hand, and grab yo' hand, now we touchin'
My lyrics are poetry, so baby get a ticket to go with me
Thugged out so you notice me
It's a positive attraction; see pictures of us
Layin' butt-naked on the beach kickin back relaxin'
And only you can calm, the savage beast
Look in my eyes are you surprised, that it's me?
I wanna make you mine
I'm kissin' on you tryin' to make it different every time (that's right)
I'm so lonely in my bedroom, lookin' at the walls
Withcha number in my hand, wonderin' should I even call her tonight

Need a thug up in yo' life (call me thug)

You got what I need (call me thug)
And shorty it's all on you

Been gettin' nuttin' but bad news, ever since the day you left me
I sit and wonder is there a way, you could forget me

Us havin' breakfast in bed, then we straight kick it
Me and you in satin sheets, 'til after two
Come take a walk on the wild side, enjoy the view
Whenever we collide; it's bound to be a pleasurable time
Makin' love 'til the early light
Sweetheart don't fight the feelin'
Come get a shot of this plain dealin' and concentrate on the ceiling
It's my intention to brush up
Beware of the fireworks, cause every time we touch..
.. it's bound to be, so relax, clown with me
As if you're down with me, get around and see
The brother with tattoos and no fears
Runnin' my fingers through your hair
If you call me

[Hook: Jazze Pha & (2Pac)]
Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life (call me thug)
Never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want (call me thug)
And girl you know I got you
You got what I need (call me thug)
And shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Pardon me, but let's be specific
Baby cause if you down with me, nigga we can kick it
And let's take trips and ride airplanes
A hundred thousand dollar car on dem gold thangs, so can you hang?
'Cause we can be real tight (right)
I got a big suite at the Hyatt , if it feel right
My only wish is to be witcha
You got me steady strivin' to getcha
Fantasizin' of friendly pictures
The pressure's gettin' major
I wonder will you answer my call, if I page ya
Got me goin' wild with anticipation
Face to face with us locked up in strange places
What will it take? cause the heartache be heatbreak
Is my prediction when you falsify and start fake?
In my position I'm a careful man, but a player when I ball
Got my eyes on you baby, can I call?

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me

And for this final selection...

[Refrain]
Punk police, punk police, punk police, punk police, punk police
Punk police, punk police, punk police, punk police, punk police
Punk police, punk police, punk police, punk police

[Verse 1]
Stop — I can't take no mo'
Why is the police steady knocking at my do'?
24/7, the devils be trippin'
They say some banks was robbed and I fit the description
But that's drama, so save it for your mama
I'm not criminal minded, punk police, I'm a
Dope rhyme dealer, not a money stealer
Was real in '91, but now I'm much realer
On the streets you roam, tryna follow me home
Steady running checks, on me and my Brougham
You see my mother is worried, you got her vision all blurry
You throwing darts at my partner's poster — and he's buried?
Resting in peace, but you won't give him no peace
Man, you punk police, I'm not the savage beast
You labeled us a ruthless G-A-N-G
But the biggest gangsters are on the VPD
They hate to see me driving a car I bought
They hate how I talk, I can't spit on the sidewalk
They roughin' and cuffin' me, in jail they be duffin' me
Every damn day, mayne, they can't get enough of me
I could maybe understand if I was breaking the law
And I'ma dedicate this to Detective McGraw
You be steady accusing, but these cases you losing
You be steady abusing, mayne, do you find it amusing?
Well, haha, haha, I'ma laugh in your face
While you kick on back and feel the bass
Punk police with a one-track mind
Man, you can't even find who's been robbing you blind
It got deep, so you had to blame somebody
What's next — you gon' frame somebody?
You gon' frame somebody?
(You gon' frame somebody?)
Is you gon' frame somebody?
(Is you gon' frame somebody?)

[Verse 2]
For the dumb punk one-time I've got one rhyme
You can't stop sweatin' me, no, not even sometime
You fuss and cuss at, would love to bust at
A brother like me, always searching my nutsack
""Punk Police"" I named this cut
And punk police, I'll tell you what
You need to stop trippin' and cold do your job
Stop tryna be ruthless and stop tryna mob
Punk police are nothin' clean
Look how they did Rodney King
In every neighborhood, state, city, and town
A crooked policeman can be found
Off-duty he never would squab hard
But give him that gat, badge and that squad car
Then it's jack time, fuck-with-a-Black time
I'm talking real, man, listen to a Mac rhyme
Listen to a Mac rhyme

Look at yourself and write down the truth. What more fatal complex subject could you find? It’s hard to face. Or maybe you’re afraid of yourself

[Verse 1]

Daylight fright. They might bite
I get so high. I’m high as a kite
Fly to new heights. I try to do right
Grow older, weight of the world’s on my shoulders
People are bad, pretend to be helpless
Mad give juice to the youth. I’m selfish
I try to explore the dark side of the road
Skeleton’s dangling. Star-spangled mangling
I’m all tangled up in two gangs I’m fucked
Devour smurf. It’s all our turf
Let’s kick through the fence and waste a few heads
But karma’s a bitch that you’ll face when you’re dead
Sweet demon, take me to a level that’s a true test
Devil in a blue dress, I’ll do what I do best
Control freak speak. Do as I say
When you and I play cause you are not safe

[Verse 2]
The mind suffers. Thoughts are all scattered
With delicate matters and elegant patterns
A trail of myself. I’m beyond redemption
Weak to temptation, I’m filled with tension
Attract acts of vengeance. I will go the length
Cause I rap with my grandfather’s strength
I will not lose my family
Miracle man, you can’t stand me
I push for my dreams. Only God can command me
Black hand dark prints of the city
It’s hideous language. Bad blood on canvas
No partners we will keep building
I swear on the lives of my unborn children
That I would burn in Hell just to keep you safe
But I will stimulate my growth while I keep my faith
Give you everything inside my skull
These are the memoirs of a troubled soul

Terrified to have a wife
Still living my life, and can't get married. Why?
'Cause I'm married-'cause I'm married to the mall

If she likes girls, that might suffice

Light up a blunt and ignite under moonlight

It broke my heart when I found out Kevin passed
I went in my cell and I prayed about ten rakat
When they killed Reece (RXR)
I cried for whole weeks
Trapped in my cell again and I felt like I couldn't breath

And I ain't comin' home for a thousand suttin' sleeps
Between guns, knives and judges I keep losin' all my G's
Give me space, let me grieve, shit
Give me space, let me breath 'cah I smile rarely
I keep a pound under my pillow like the tooth fairy
Who can I trust? Not him or you clearly
'Cah I'm talkin', Old Bailey
Fightin' for your life in a suit scary, shit
Got me thinkin' 'bout my young hitter Eyez
And Eyez didn't do it but they still gave him life
And Tiny Jumbo, he was wrong place, wrong time
When I think about their mothers, brings tears to my eyes
'Cah where I'm from your day ones'll hate you on the slight
Just 'cause you're doin' better but you'd love me if I died
Put my picture and never ride, man, I've seen it before
Gettin' liquored 'till three in the morn'
And why this gang's still the street to my core
I got pain embedded deep in my thoughts
I say the richer the man, the cheaper the talk
Still, I'm grateful nowadays it ain't as peak as before
When I was homeless and sick he'd let me sleep on his floor
Nanny loves me even though I bring beef to the door
So much police to the door
Shit, it's cold in these streets in my Canada Grey Goose
I got coke on the streets like Pablo and Jesus
I said if we're rich, if we're poor now, I just gotta make do
Five in the trey deuce, blacked out like Wayne Bruce
I find it funny that everybody's so friendly
When I was banged up all my teens, most of my twenties
And man were sayin' free me but never sent me a penny
Ten toes in the mud, no dwellies, I got some Fendi
Like, are you a gangster rapper or you just rapping gangster?
'Cah if you ask me, I think all these rappers are jezzies
They're dick ridin' and pic likin', I sit silent
I been fist fightin', big knifin' and spliff lightin'
Like, my wrist shinin', big diamonds, still twin 9 him
Ching olders, I ching minors, I'm sick minded
Man'll use you when they need you, that fake love'll confuse you
Fuckboys in real life but gangsters when they're on YouTube
I got lifers on my set, doin' numbers like Sudoku
I said dua'a in my cell, I buss it with no voodoo
My spinners, it hold six, my block does whole bricks
My bitch got her own tits and her body's like 'oh shits'
Amiri's with no rips, this splash, it's no drip
I fell in love with the block and I never went home since
Real gangsters don't snitch lookin' death in the face
Welcome to London city, it's a treacherous place
Everybody lost someone they can never replace
And a coffin or a cell is only seconds away
Feds stopped me and they search me
And they're checkin' my name
And if they find what's in my balls, that's a ten or a eight
Plus a recall with a guilty plea
I'd rather that than let them kill the G
In the mornin', light my spliff up with a milky tea
I ain't filthy rich but I'm filthy free
Early mornin' with a milky tea
'Cah I ain't filthy rich but I'm filthy free like

[Verse 1: MIKE]
Tryna get it, get it (Get it)
No time to get up, I be smoking ’til I feel beheaded (Yeah)
For the ones who wish it on me, hope these niggas perish
We was flying over London, wasn’t interference (Nah)
But I could see it all, I saw my vision clearing (Uh)
You can’t compare
I feel the whisper hit my ear when I be in the air and (Yeah)
Took my sister ‘cause she missed her hearing
I swear I miss my parent
We was ready for the war if you quick to clear in
Since I was in the carriage
Holding in this frown like when you feel embarrassed
And instead of caring, I was heavy staring
Hoping not to feel despair

[Chorus: MIKE & Medhane]
Hungry when I feel the air
Never sitting on a thought because my mission shared
If the last one didn’t work, we’d try a different prayer

Hungry when I feel the air
Never sitting on a thought because my mission shared
If the last one didn’t work, we’d try a different prayer
Try a different prayer

Feel the changes in the air (Yeah)
Grew without a brother, so I keep some near (Near)
Who was really with you when you needed them? (Them, uh)
Sun gon’ shine, hope to see the end (End)
Absentee mind, but the wisdom reach mine
Know they tryna bleed mine, making up for D-time
I’m lost to this shit (to this shit)
What’s the cost for the lord to assist? (To assist)
Lost focus, found fog
Still my brothers shining, I’m in awe
Swim through waves to reach the shore
Know I felt the peace before
Need a bag for all the scars
Skin blacker than the star zone
Still it’s hard to catch him like a long throw

[Chorus: MIKE & Medhane]
When I feel the air (Under where I’m from, uh)
Never sitting on a thought because my mission shared
If the last one didn’t work, we’d try a different prayer

You herbs, we merged, we're an alliance
We fight fire with flamethrowers, why would you try us?
We a outfit, equivalent to Voltrons
That boy Crooked I's equivalent to four arms
Joell Ortiz is the body
The cannibal-slash-killer: kill you, then eat your body
Joe Budden is the pair of legs
He run shit, alongside I, the apparent head
I am the general, bow now
Fuck saluting, I don't really think y'all niggas get it
Run up on you with an army, it is on 'til it's done, finished
You got a problem with any one of my Slaughters
Then y'all niggas can come with us
Me and Joey, we a perfect fit, he like startin' shit, I like endin' shit
I don't squash the beef, I don't bend a bit
It ain't intricate, I'm gon' shoot your stupid ass
You choose to laugh, you gon' die smilin, try wildin'
I get hostile, then I'm violent
I don't make threats, nigga, I promise
My style is Stalin mixed with sick lyrics
If you hear it, it'll lift your spirit
Turn your appearance to a disappearance

I got a raw flow, and I stay hungry more so
Guess that's why I'm the torso
I pour sweat when I perform shows
What I record goes down as the best
But the vets won't let that torch go
Y'all can keep it, they got flashlights now, and flamethrowers
And I got one on my back right now—""Remain focused""
That's what I tell myself now and then
Don't wanna go back to that block like where Varejao defends
Uh-oh, my stomach growls again
I ain't none of you cowards' friends
Every human out of my sight before I count to ten (Woo!)
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
I'm hungry like I never ate (Rrrrrr)
Set a table up with knives, forks, and spoons
I'm 'bout to get a plate
All these weak dummies lookin' yummy like a pepper steak
Me and these streets'll never separate, we ain't married
Yeah, but every time I touch a pen, I sorta set a date
I'll devastate your career, look, I'ma demonstrate
Let me get a good breath I take before I regulate
Okay, bye-bye, you guys
Don't try to rhyme 'cause line for line, what I design is mine
And my point is: I'm divine and I'm right behind
The big guy that shines all the light in mine
So my eyes can find a nice dime to grind
Come here, girl—toma, toma, take that, take that!

Buying too many size 20 skinny jeans
The West treat me like I'm really king
I'm Pacquiao in the Philippines, illest thing them niggas seen
You rappers dressing like you finna sing ""Billie Jean""
I gotta intervene—fuck you, I'ma intervene
You loud-talking wouldn't kill a thing
Matter of fact, where's your head, nigga? I got the guillotine
Fuck your Hollywood limousine and rented bling
I give you three red dots and I call it a triple-beam
I'll put your pad on your property, fag
Properly rob you and hop in the Jag
If you stopping the profit, the Glock'll be popping
Your body'll rock a colostomy bag
Shot in the abs, moms'll be sad, pops'll be mad, doctor be glad
Possibly stopping the plasma dropping
Clock running out and the outcome bad
Any one of you niggas that fuck with my team
Pretty-ass thing with the infrared beam
Sleep on that and get killed while you dream
Fuck a rap group, Slaughterhouse a machine
Slaughterhouse a regime
I'm gooned up if you know what I mean

My one goal's to astonish
Tell the President, V.P., (You could) notify the Congress
They say I'm arrogant, pompous, but I'm honest
I tell 'em, ""Keep an accomplice away from the accomplished""
They still making threats on Your Highness
But I tell 'em where I be, they just ignore the compass
I think all your mans Play-Doh
I don't buy that movie, ""Fandango,"" fans they know that, what!
You a soldier to a general, baby steel
Got it in the bag, airtight, Navy SEAL
Tell lil' dudes, I ain't mad at y'all, college kids like Asher Roth
Y'all just trying to put food on the table
Well, I'ma just come and try snatch it off
If it ain't for me, most young dudes'd be angrily (Whoa, whoa)
But anxiously awaiting bankruptcy
Wonder what makes lil' motherfuckers think they're the same as me
I'm synchronized, you and your mans'll die
Learn certain shit you ain't meant to try
Got the ground covered with some niggas in disguise
Best bet's to attempt to fly
Shit's a gang, you down, you in for life
Fuck y'all, I ain't gotta generalize
Y'all ain't able to write what the pen describes
So when he ask what I meant and why, I tell him

Youngest nigga in my city that'll drill off a scooter
Like a bad yellow bitch but sometimes I be with thooter
Ain't no cappin' bitch, we gettin' to that bag, nigga's losers
Got some young wild niggas that'll strip you for your chain
And I ain't fuckin' with no nigga that been fuckin' up his name
Pull up on you with some drill, pussy nigga switching lanes
We can't talk about my brother nigga, you don't feel the same

This Wu shit be hard to kill at full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editin' tracks that's rough
'Cause a jam without a live MC isn't enough
So we attack this, and grab all within reach
Throw a scrap back to niggas, perfect your own speech
Shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
Used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands
Niggas look on and get hooked on this mic line
Reeled in and shipped through the pipeline
LPs delivered with style and potential
Niggas flowin' smoothly in a sequential order
Revealin' hidden tape recorders
Stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura

Watch he act up, fifty-two block track we slap up
Playground maneuver, jet to Vancouver like this
Two Kahluas, one chick, she's German Luger
Get the shit on
Light a fresh pack, bust it open with the seal on, dunn
Deal on this, with the real on
Necks rocky ring, call it the Decatur
Slang souffléer, home decorater, player
Mic immigrants, nine of us formed resemblance

Peep the ornaments enough to make Shorty-Wop stare at me yo

Yo, MC's wonder what's hip-hop thunder?
Tell you the truth, it's just one nation under a groove
Gettin' down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the biz...
Yo, inhale this paraphernalia, a Wu memorabilia
Melba the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
'Bout the group recruit, we scoop up CREAM like Breyer's
Then spread across the globe like telephone wires
Thirty-six assorted, Shaolin imported chambers been recorded
You're fuckin' with the loops, time for royalty audit
Fabulous establishment metabolism, Blackfoot Indian
Cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
Then grew to a physical body with five meridians
As the pendulum swings closer to the millennium 2000
Wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I gotta muscle the industrial to make a hustle
And politic with Lyor and Russell

Deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceilin'
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuin' to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, Glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and who's liable

Fiend for the capo regimes of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery

I tell her, ""Bitch stop killin' my vibe, let's talk music and love
Let's stop abusin' each other and start abusin' these drugs""
I'm just tryna dumb life down if it ain't stupid enough
I let reality slip because it's losin' its touch
Still singin'

Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can't think of any words to tell her how I feel inside
I'm just gazin' at reflections I'm projectin' with my mind
Grab my weapon and my set list.  Not exempt from any crimes

Got my partner, he's a warrior, know he's seen some dark times
Quick to ball up white knuckles, never one to spark 9s
Bitch, I rap for dudes like him, that's why I tear apart lines
I'm tryna separate the darkness and that's no apartheid

I'm at war with myself and I've committed war crimes
I've done smoked so many blunts that I done felt my heart whine
I've been labeled as a loser by my peers too many times
I done seen my different egos bitch and fight that intertwine
And I'm sick of it, introspective with a pimpin' twist in my penmanship
And I ain't finished shit. First mixtape to the third, done when the dinner's fixed
At the end of the day I'm offended by players and anyone takin' for granted
I'm coming with something for someone forgotten
Skin'll just harden, face full of granite
I'm talkin' 'bout you, boo, feel it in the heart and soul apart from goals forgotten
Put it down trodden, Imma need a minute or so, I've omitted the flow to sound rotten
Feelin' uh, tell 'em all grip the barrel, [?]
Blow your mind, blow your mind, hold it down standin' tall

Been workin' on this flow since day one.  Hurtin' for [?]
[?] golden days.  Focus on this [?]
Only stay face-up [?] but it's stale in a minute
Failed to relive it, failed like a gimmick, unveiled on the limits that'll make change numb
But he'll never give into livin' a hell that's been written in the back of his mind, half of it tryin', sad by design, his ass on the line
Been a long time since he hasn't been lyin'
But the truth don't matter when the facts are designed without passion inside without passin' the time
Had to rehash at his act 'til cryin', had to get back into act to get by
[?] like he had to decide it like that he divided up all of the pieces t
[?] when the puzzles had all of his faults
Every last plan dissolved into back handed insults
That brought life down to a halt, and saw right down to his fall
Like he can feel it changin'.  Yo, fuck the pain, he's angry
Loves to break it all, love to make it all fuckin' entertainin'
So he blamin' it all on the people around, beginnin' to think that they bringin' him down
Even start thinkin' [?]
So even to say he just shut them all out
But his anger never faded and every day's the same and
Everything that he is, the way that he live, feel over stayed-in
Yellin', ""Bitch don't kill my vibe,"" but it still don't feel alright
When the only thing that keep him holdin' it back is the inner peace that he di'n't have

Flip tail, so let me see you shake it up like dice
The way you shake your rump is turnin' mighty men to mice

Slave to the pussy, but I’m just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don’t I got that shit the world, wanna hear again?
Don’t Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me, paint drying
I’m never tripping over anything that ain't mine
I’m hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time

Baby after baby, lost her shape as of lately
Used to spend the quiet nights home, now she likes to roam
Feelin' quite grown, caught in life's cyclone
I was taught be the wise ""apply the knowledge passed""
To advance, learn the science of life and earn the masters
Trapped in the havoc, I'm forced to go the whole
Although, it might spell a jail cell and no parole
I fight with the force of Steve Austin
Until my arms can no longer hold off the coffin
In this ghetto Heaven, God bless the children
Whose shattered dreams are offered and hard to mend
We don't believe in Heaven, we livin' in Hell

Draped in Bape, we the young gorillas

Every time I feel like I’m doing something
Worthwhile, for time that it exists
Whipping and cooking that real shit
Talking like someone that kills shit
When did the feel miss?
Don’t really know when we spill shit
Live for the change
So much black I feel like shade
One of the same when I feel so strange
And I gather the squad, cuz I feel like Pein
My brain hurts
Everybody know I strain first
Level up now with the Flame Burst
When I spit loud you'll see the flame burst

Plan the attack, I'm an acid assassin
Melting the chains of the belt that’s fastened tight
Walk in your house with all white
Looking like I’m Jesus Christ
Words that persist from the priest that resists
The meaning of existence
Live the resistance life
Walk around town feeling like the Dark Knight
The feelings arise
Live for the morning, I live for the life
Live for the brain where the dreams do reside
So you know when the time for the feelings arise
I want to exist
Constructive meaning always feels dismissed
Never have time to revise the position
Of living a life at the time of the mission

Will I go because the life I'm livin' feel like heaven (feel like heaven)

Grown better man still I'm in my gang attire
Does not mean I'm going to be cast into a ring of fire
Does it? If so them words you speak I can't admire
The evil's in my past but today the saint is ours
Get and give a lot of love, guess my Allah just follows us
I was stuck, taught us, now we caught up in goddish hugs
Everywhere we go, there he go, went from very low
To unnecessary owes when he carries flows over the stereo
I'm, on my 7 all because of rhyme
But because I played the 6 once upon a time
The reverend says my worldly ways I need to deaden
But I can't tell because this life I'm living feel like heaven

Is it heaven, or is my head up in the clouds
Is there hell for me, cause I feel like we made it out
I put my halo on but then, it done came off again
You don't need eyes to see, that this could be our only heaven

It's funny, and when I think I'm up there...
They say I fais le cul to much

Yeah I'm tied to you because I was thinking semantics
So is it dependent on what your heaven is?
Or how big your 6 and 7 is?
Everything preaches to you, you decipher who the reverend is
This verse is speaking to the ones seeking peace in any form
Far from norm' imaginations, the brain rains when it storms
You say names then it forms, manifest things that were foreign
To you once upon a time no coincidence is gonna rhyme
Make sense in a normal line
Of words you learned them at the time and they remain timeless
Feeding of the dreams that you promised
Before niggas knew you were prominent and dominant
And all those powerful words that back then, to be honest
Were just nouns and verbs; the looks on the astonished
Are normal by now I seen them same faces when I was in Spiderman pajamas
[Chorus: Nikkiya]
So, if you see my feet up off the ground
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
Oh, if you see my halo falling down
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down

[Bridge 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Heaven or hell?
I never thought that this could be so real
I never thought that I would ever build
My own heaven

[Chorus: Nikkiya]
So, if you see my feet up off the ground
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
Oh, if you see my halo falling down
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
I remember back in the day I had this song called ""My Own Hell.""
It was depressing
But since then, I've created my own heaven, baby!
And it's beautiful!

[Outro 2: Tech N9ne]
Incredibly no one deaded me when it was lead at these red Dickies
Nobody beheaded me, let it be, said I'm breaded B
Real light, within darkness I still fight it
But if heaven is love, then this sure in the hell feel like it!",7508,62688

Sick, with a little dro', sick, with a little dough
Sick, with a little flow make you love it a lot
Quick cause I gotta' do it
And I gotta' rep for the rich and the little po' ho tuggin' on the block
Chicks in the mink sit in the back seat when I'm on a strip and I roll in the drop
Sip a little bit of 'gac dip a little when I whip the Cadillac truck throwin' it up
And we gotta' put it down and keep it pimpin' 'til they cannot deny
Just grab yo' bottles and keep sippin', throw your hands in the sky
All of my, people (people), keep it (keep it), goin' (wassup)

Just make sure that you keep up
No clean up, pull on blocks and sweep up
What would you do if you bucked me and Creeper
Step in the dance and my tunes get wheel up
They hide on their block when they hear this beater
Seen him, he's mine, that's finders keepers
Run down a paigon, bore up his Fila

I told bro that he's mine but he got there first
LOL, got me standing at lights
Broad day or evening, get burst

Start doing legs when they seeing it spin

(Section 8 just straight cooked that muhfucker up)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Baby]
I just put a Mansory kit on top of a Lamb' truck
I know how it feels to stay down and run you some bands up
Hundred grand on me, it's hard holdin' my pants up
TRX, the Hellcat motor inside a RAM truck
Real ones like me hard to come by, it's only a handful
Ain't no money in the world that make me give my mans up

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I know how it feel to think everybody against you
I know how it feel to watch bullets go through a windshield
I know how it feel when you try your best to be real
I know how it feel when you think no one understands you
I know how it feel when the one you love gettin' ran through
I know how it feel, I done really cut off my mans too
I know how it feel when you broke, and them bills past due
Oh, you thought this shit was a joke? We on your ass too
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I can't give my energy to anybody
I'm a billionaire in the making, I promise I'ma get one
Lil' bitch tried to chase me, I had to stiff-arm her
Only had a couple dollars, I was still gettin' fresh
I ain't tryna say I'm cocky, but I feel I'm the best
Every time, I want the maximum, ain't takin' nothin' less
I've been back-to-back jets, but I still fly Delta
Thick lil' shit, but she can fit in my schedule
Yeah, always on the go, but I make time for that ass
Know I got a lot, but I'm on the grind, tryna get mad rich
I know I be calm, but I'm nowhere near average
A hundred million dollars cold cash gettin' buried
Lookin' at the man I'm becomin', it's gettin' scary
All these bitches fuckin' whoever, who gettin' married?
I ain't tryna go back to nothin', I'm tryna have shit
I be quick to pick up that blicky, I got a bad wrist

I know how it feel to wake up cut up from them bed springs (Yeah, yeah)
I know how it feel not to eat, it give you head pain (Yeah, yeah)
I know how it feel to talk to granny and forget everything (Yeah)
I just sat in jail with a bond, couldn't bond out
I know how it feel to dodge school, smoke the garage out
I know how it feel, the bitch you love fuckin' bums now
Rushin' while you cheatin', usin' water to get the cum out (Yeah)
I know how it feel to lose your brother to the trenches (Trenches)

Lyin' on some murders, actin' turnt like he did it
Slidin' in a Demon, but lowkey, he a Christian (Skrrt)

I'm grabbing grain, in the turning lane
And I gotta maintain (cause the law behind me)
I've tried to leave the game, I know I need to change
(I need to resco' again) meet me on Fondren & Main

[Z-Ro]
I was a superstar at seventeen
Famous in the ghetto, for working a triple beam
Somebody told me it was destiny, for me to suffer
Cause when the going gets rough, it only gets rougher
I had to make a quick change from Lunchables, and a spot on the bus
To eating at Papadeauxx everyday, and a Suburban with bump
I got the game from my partna, but all he told me was Ro
Before you get your
Feet wet partna, you better be sho
If you get caught it's Penitentiary time
Understand
Fronted me nine, and now we got the hottest on the van
My grandmother knew what it was doing, because my pockets stuck out
And plus
She told me I love you, but get your shit out my house
All I ever wanted to do, was just shine a little
Bump and grind a little, and then recline a little
Trying to protain, lavish have it like the H.A.W.K
You need another zone then I'm on my way, because I'm trapped in the game
[Hook]

[Dougie D]
Well I done came from crumbs to bricks
While I'm hustling up in the city streets
On the block of Fondren and Main, coppers know where the killas be
When I get out I'm gonna make me a change
The whole situation, seemed a bit strange
Everybody wanna die, somebody brain
Dougie D, trying to collect a little change
And grip the grain, swang turning lanes
With a whole bunch of hoes, yelling out my name
Pop trunk open wide, up in down South mayn
And when I work the wood, I lean on maintain
Or put it on your brain, ain't worried bout a damn thang
Without leaving this shit, and everybody need to change
But plus again, ain't worried bout a damn thang
Set up shop, up on Fondren and Main

[Taz]
I wish I was the one with the top down
In a chromed out Benz, with all my friends
Bank account, with unlimited ends
Gripping, I ain't sweating the rent
The only problem is, I'm a FED fella
With no intentions on, taking a loss
And everytime I see the law, my heart pauses
Riding dirty, everytime I'm flossing
I got tossed in the game, at a early age
Trying to push pounds and tons
Looking for fortune and fame
Through the smoke of my Mary Jane
Trying to control the game
Instead of trying to find another way to stay paid
I was stuck at a materialistic stage
Now I have a piece and chain, with expensive shades
Trying to resco' again, now I got two chances
I could pay the cost, and everyone they take a loss
So when the laws come, shake em off
Headed for the border man, I'm making it cross
Or I could break off a tight job, and do it right this time
Is you crazy baby, I gots to grind

Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
The prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome, is usually
A beat down brutally, fuck who you be, or where you from
West or East coast, squeeze toast, leave most
In the blood they layin' in, ask Tray and them

[Verse 2: Tracey Lee]
Oh shit, I suppose it's, time to go snitch
Flip a line and get the show lit
You clown niggas hold it
Down your flow lax, just so you know that
We could battle for days like old cats
Black, you dealin' with a throw back
Winnin' like straight jacks, with a wide range of rhyme teams
My lyrics they bang like migraines
Nigga my name's, Tray the terrible
Philadelph, wild child incredible
Too sick for medical attention (aaahhh), people listen
It's verbal ascension, like Maxwell many dimensions
Flood over tracks, well, mics in critical condition
Killin' ya Maxell, unveil lyrical skills unknown
For my peoples with illegal cell phones
A real MC let's bring it back home
Live from the two-one-five, that lost a back bone
In charge, and heavily armed like Brett Favre
You for saw it, nigga stay down
Biggie make them hit the floor face down

What, what, what
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell, when the bar-rel's in your mouth

But they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't, ran up in your shell about a dozen

Ya chest plate, contemplates, you 'bout to die nigga wait

Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
From Branson, now we lampin', twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off Get Money, Player's Anthem
Don't forget, One More Chance and, my other hits

Robbery come naturally, in and out like fuckin' rapidly
Pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be
Talkin' blasphemy, blastin' me, your family, rest in coffins often

Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
Slash gorilla, slash illest turned iller

So nigga keep ya hands high
Run all your so-called possessions, links with baguettes in
Keys to your Lex, for us to make your shorties dressed in
A full jack maneuver, don't nobody move, just the moolah
It's RNF and Junior, M.A.F., runnin' through ya like Kahlua
If rum sung then you fly, niggas with the 45
But true lies, you brought out the real nigga in me

Pi,rap,Hard 'n Phirm,2005,"[Verse 1]
When ink and pen in hands of men inscribe your form, bipedal P
They draw an altar on which God has slaughtered all stability
No eyes could ever soak in all the places you anoint
And yet to see you all at once, we only need the point
Flirting with infinity
Your geometric progeny
That fit inside you oh so tight
With triangles that feel so right

[Verse 2]
Your ever-constant homily says flaw is discipline
The patron saint of imperfection frees us from our sin
And if our transcendental lift should find a final floor
Then man will know the death of God where wonder was before

[Interlude]
Yeah, I know this pi shit backwards and forwards
Check it out
[Verse 3]
I did three chicks then I pointed at the door
A girl entered in so that made it four
I snapped one time then came another five
Add 'em all up and that makes nine
The average age 26.5
Now that's what I call gettin' some pi
Five of the chicks wore six-inch heels
Two of the nine squealed like seals
514 was the area code
Quebec, Canada, my winter abode
In my 1.3 million dollar Chalet
Pi backwards, pi forwards, all night and all day

Work so fucking much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone (I'm lovin' it!)
People calling me, askin' me for money, man (Uh)
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, livin' how I'm livin', fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, drivin' through the sticks
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waitin' forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothin' at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard
Uh, but it's hard

God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm livin' divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out (And I'm dripped out)
Right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wonderin', ""How so?""
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
""Can I do it like you do it?"" That's what they be askin' us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never actin' up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasin' fame, chasin' glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is yo' sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like I’m just not yo' sister at all—all
Uh, I’m sorry for callin' and bawlin', I’m all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he ain’t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't—you ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me

[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya. Hm-hm, I love you, son, bye",1318913,506
No Complaints No Conversation,rap,Watsky,2018,"[Verse 1]
There's something wrong with her
There's something wrong with me
I don't think that's so wrong, we came by it honestly
And honestly, I think mostly everybody does
I don't blame you if you need to catch a buzz
I've built so much armor, but ring the alarm
I'm in love with someone who's bringing me harm
I'll pick lovers who got monsters and we bond on mental health
'Til they remind me of what's ugly in myself

[Chorus]
But other than that
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
I got no complaints
[Verse 2]
I'm always on the brink
About to fly or sink
A minion with opinions told me that I shouldn't think so hard
That shit just made me think so hard I couldn't sleep a wink
Washed my red flags with my white flags and now all my laundry's pink
I'm petty at best, someone to pity at worst
Putty in beautiful hands, potty mouth ready to curse
Cursed to be curious if all this is a scam
And I had to Google narcissist to check if that's what I am

Either you get nothing
But they make you pay and pay
Or you get it till they take it all away
Every day, every day
It amazes me a hundred brand new faces
But I'm still trying to figure out who they is, shi-
I don't wanna settle one bit
Bet that I'm gonna battle for somebody, but if
I look at what we got and catch rot
Then I'm gonna come in with a hatchet and I cut it down quick
Cut around rust, cut around mold
Everybody ends up cold
Heads gotta roll, that's life
And you gotta be the neck or the knife
But I'm told that I can't quite quit this
Constant itch to matter, my restless drive to win
That's driving me, that drove away the closest of my kin
How I twist away when deep relationships begin
And shit, there's still the b'iness of the thinness of my skin
I'm vain, I'm lame, I'm strange and yet so typical
I make the same mistakes, I don't change shit, and still
My folks age and age, I hate to face facts
And I feel I wear their faces as a mask
[Chorus]
But other than that (I wear their faces as a mask)
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
(I wear their faces as a mask)
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation

Forever dreaming the moments that take my breath away
I was thinking about you yesterday
I know you hurt cause you always putting in work
But what’s making it worse is I’m just another man on your resume
I miss the swishers we lit up until we’d levitate
I come to get you if ever you need a getaway
If you don’t come through, I’m still the man you can run to
And I don’t want nothing from you
Shit, I’m just hoping this resonates

Tell me what you scared of
I promise I won't hurt you
You know I’m gon’ protect you
You know I’m gon’ preserve you
No, I will not desert you
No, I do not deserve you
And I don’t know what’s perfect, but I know I prefer you
And I don’t mean to disturb you
But baby let me refer you
Cause I’m about to show you everything

You gauge attraction, then gain attachment
Its days are laughing
You way too happy, it fades to blackness
Then it's ""wait what happened?""
I thought I loved you, I hate you actually
Last time I fucked you I thought you’d make me a baby daddy
But I’m alone now and baby I ain't slowing down
Just hit me when you want to see me and it’s going down
Cause I could pull up to your city in your hometown
Got your own crib cause you grown now
You the only reason I’m here
You're my one obsession I like
You're the only reason I breathe when there’s nothing left in my pipe
If I had me another chance and I know I would make it right
If you find you another man, then I know I’ma take his life
I hope I see at the crossroads
But only you and only god knows
Baby you lost I know you know that I’m the only one that finds you baby
If you forgot, I’ll take this moment to remind you baby

Everything I

Got hoes

We will find the angle, starting with convention
On to innovation; everything's connected

This will be the basis for your revolution
Gravity is crucial, geomagnetism

Kids with diabetes, Pentecostal preachers

Mothers under 20, interracial couples

Xenophobes and racists, private aviators
Everyone will see it, every demographic

Think about it this way: guided evolution
This will be a new breed: cutting edge, but classic

Symbolizing freedom, and, of course, your product

Everyone's rebranded, all the fighting's over

Then I set a fucking fire in this church, ayy
Let it burn in the flames, Satan save me
Got the devil in my soul, got the craving
To murder every fucker trying to face me
'Cause I'm sick of this shit, I just hate it
Can you end my fucking life, Satan save me?

[Verse]
Come from the grave, Satan, my slave, I commit murder everyday
I got the fire, I got the pain, all in my vein everyday
Burning the church, I'm on a purge, I do the murder, 'cause I got the urge
I do the murder, 'cause I want the pain, I do the murder, 'cause I'm the insane
I sold my soul, bought some dope, bought some methadone and crack
I got no hope, I'm so low, dopamine, can you come back?
I got no life, take the knife, slit my throat, I die tonight
I see the light, black and white, Lucifer just took my life
[Bridge]
Lucifer just took my life
Exodus deadly and venomous
I be the nemesis, invert the crucifix, uh
Killer, the killer, the creep and the villain
Bitch, I am the devil, no stopping me now

[Chorus]
Triple fucking six in this bitch, ayy
Bitch, I burn a fucking witch, voodoo shit, ayy
Then I set a fucking fire in this church, ayy
Let it burn in the flames, Satan save me
Got the devil in my soul, got the craving

There must be a way. The Viking found one

Melodic, hypnotic productions. Prevail
Autobiographic, it becomes classic
Identity: Peter Parker. Spiderman

[Verse 1: Prevail]
Web fluid substance help me stick to the mortar brick
Half-mortal portraits make a poor man rich
From the ditch to the foxhole, use a skeleton key
For what you can't see through the eye-hole, it's like 1408.
Live life altered state
Hydroplane interstate
We construct, we conduct, like an orchestra pit
But more focused and shit
Cut competition like orchids in the Little Shop of Horrors
I riddle rappers with the recoil, cause I can spit with force
Rip up blunts like it was ricochet, pick my prey
Use my primal instinct 'til they slip away
Purgatory's gray, Hell is dark, Heaven's white and gold
Now you try your best to leave your mark before it all unfolds
Eyes will be forever closed
Families stand on cemetery rows, carry a dozen rose
Bury you with bulldozers
Grass grows around you and no one ever gonna know
What you thought you'd amount to
The cleaver's too clever for the reaver to renounce you

Fighting with good and evil
Give you nightmares
Now into the labyrinth of Madchild's music

Yeah, now that I'm straight edge, I'm sharper than a straight edge
Reminiscent of the B-Boy Summit with a shaved head
My form, breathing like a firestorm
Tweeting on my iPhone, Monster in my Styrofoam
Teamwork makes the dream work, first it seemed worse
Now the situation you're about to see the seams burst
It's explosive, I'm so full of emotion
I can't help but be a bit ferocious
Approach us, I'm focused
The joke is that we are now the brokest
Richer than we've ever been, we swarm like the locust
Every verse I spit is catapulted into outer space
Every line's a shot of Mace, feeling like I'm out of place
Pretty boy to a fucking man with a rough face
Touch base with a nutcase in a tough place
Suck face with a rattlesnake, wrestle alligators
Bear fightin', I'm a rare Titan and a gladiator
Very influential for those who have potential
I'm mental, nothing that I do is accidental
Now that I'm back we've got our people now they're praying for us
Without commitment, we in trouble like the rain forest",2878,108477

My momma told me speak; but words are held accountable
Speaking starvation, feeling worthless cause my mouth is full
Work is insurmountable, curve me with the palpables
Unexplained abstracts: serving by the mountainful
Circuits I just drown into, a circus sans a clown or two
Work, slack, work, what the fuck has that amounted to?
Awkward interactions at the grocery store
Homies turn to overlords
The least holy tend to win that holy war
Sonic with the conies, boy

Boy I count pennies but never ever spend them shits
Special K; gnarly dude, I'm sloppy as my penmanship
Watch me while I live this shit, silly with the gunplay
Cartoons and Cereal; I'm really with the Gunplay
Ride 'til I die, or 'til I crash into a Hyundai
Raw with the flow, I feel like every night is Monday

Butterfly abundant, cuz, tighter than a tummy tuck
Pumice and the bumble buck: buzzing while I'm stoned as hell
I've seen stranger things but I don't know Winona well

Pimping on a budget like it's Don Juan's Kia

Who am I to know? How am I to say
Things to make it better, to make it go away
I want to make you proud, I know that you're ashamed
Ask you what the problem is, you tell me you're ok
Love was always found, we lost it on the way
There used to be a wall, now it's gone without a trace
We said it all, now there's nothing left to say
Cause' you always get me wrong, like it's always my mistake
Then you say it's not your fault, that we argue every day
Now you leave me with no choice, man how much I got to take?

Looking at your eyes, poring like the rain
You hide it with a smile, but I can see the pain

As far as rap I'm not the one to toe-to-toe with or go at it blow for blow with the silly shit no for no with
Money on the line, its money all on my mind
Calculating this vision, I sum it up for the grind
I promise when I got it I'd fuck it up for the times
Put 20k on the tab and buss it up every time, you get me?
In a Bentley smokin' on a fat 20, jealous niggas don't offend me, Dior dripped in the Fendi
I do it for the family OGs that never sent me on mission when I was down to put clip in and leave it empty and work
I ain't trippin' 'bout who got at me and dissed
I'm blessed, when I think about who shot at me and missed
I came from real situations
Niggas got clapped for little insinuations, time and impatience
Been grindin', finding my way in so much bros like the Wayans
Sometime it weigh me down whenever they try weigh in
In the day out, in the day in, shooters on say when
Niggas got clapped before the day end
The city I come from, taught me that there's nothing to run from
It taught me get my money in lump sums
So 'til that day, still at war, I'm still at pay
Never change boy, we still that way
It's young Fargo",6408,69131

And if you stayin by my side, imma take you for a ride girl
I know you feelin it inside, there's some shit you can't deny girl
And if you stayin by my side, imma take you for a ride girl
I know you feelin it inside, there's some shit you can't deny girl

Every time she smiles at me, I feel like I'm unstoppable
Happiness like this I never really thought was possible
Absolutely beautiful, she's everything to me
If we had never met, I can't imagine where I'd be
She's more than just my girl, cause see together we're a team
Before I knew her name, I knew I met her in a dream
Now she sleep beside me every night and treat me like a king
Her voice is like an angel, I just listen to her sing
When my confidence was low and all I did was second guess
Everything I've done so far, she told me I'm the best
This song is for my shorty, she's above all of the rest
She knows exactly how to ease my mind when I am stressed
There's something 'bout the way she moves, must be how she shakes her hips
The way she laughs when we kiss, I just wanna taste her lips
The only one I truly trust, I'm just tryna let her know I love her more than anything and I ain't tryna let her go

And if you stayin by my side, imma take you for a ride girl
I know you feelin it inside, there's some shit you can't deny girl
And if you stayin by my side, imma take you for a ride girl
I know you feelin it inside, there's some shit you can't deny girl

It's just you and me against the world, nobody can come between
Sexy, smart and talented, the cutest smile I ever seen
The type of girl that other girls wishin they could be
She's passionate about her craft, she's motivated to succeed
She's got a lot of wisdom so I listen when she speaks
She keeps me eating healthy, in the kitchen she's a beast
She texts me sexy pictures every time that we're apart
More than just a hottie cause her body's like a work of art
Hypnotized by a rise and I can't snap out of it
Don't mess with other girls, cause I'm loyal and I'm proud of it
Two or all around the globe, we ain't gotta be alone
Don't matter where we go cause when I'm with her I am home
Yeah it feels so good I can't explain, holding hands in the rain
Just in case you didn't hear it let me say it all again
The only one I truly trust, I'm just tryna let her know I love her more than anything and I ain't tryna let her go

And if you stayin by my side, imma take you for a ride girl
I know you feelin it inside, there's some shit you can't deny girl
And if you stayin by my side, imma take you for a ride girl

While broski pavement revs and, we don’t take no chances

Nuff gyal will say that I’m heartless
Girl just shut up your mouth stop talking
And hold onto bass when we’re walking
[Verse 2 - Sav12]
Opp block settings just got suggested
Back then on a 400 now it’s 300 settings
15 inch when we dish out cheffings
They’re chining up females like how u things through leggings
Waist n up we don’t aim where the leg is
I stepped in the field with tekkers mummy shoulda named me Neymar
If I buck jakes I turn to a skater
If you slept on me you best wake up
I can see true colours without throwing water on makeup
Can't tell me about black man timing
You think your late but I’m later
Queen Elizabeth chaser ay
And I took enough risks on a 125
Sav12’s really on piss your face got wacked in front of your guys
He jump on tracks and tell lies
Or they mention work that was not mashed by none of their guys
Lurk with things and stuff when we ride

Give me an hour, I'll get rid of that
Next thing that she saw was racks
Smile on her face, got her looking all happed
I'm deep in the trap
I'm in love with grinding
My phones rings I'm excited
Forced them bud in the baggy
Man can't tell me nothing bout sizes
If you do then you're lying, you're lying
Big bros in the kitchen, he can't whip it
But he risked it and tried it
I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the big man crying
He lost it all, I couldn't help but I started smiling
He said ""Sav this far from a joke|
I can't do shit, it's strictly my dough
Call up my man I need more coke
Me I ring trap in ends
While big broski's trapping in O
Free up the locked up members
I can't wait till them man come home

When I rass this bud to the dome
More time slide with the gang

In my back pocket, take Jade on vacation
The hotel switch from Heartbreak to Bates quick
Rippin' out braids with bare hands amazes
The crowd go crazy, hands raised, I'm laced with
Swag by the eighth in case you wanna taste it
Faggots wear Prada, Satan wears RMK shit
Hell's angel, crack Christ 'cross the face
With erasers and use Based God as his replacement
Super Saiyan with ruthless slayings
Eat puss, sweet puss got my tooth decayin'

Amateur threesome with Hannah Montana's manager
And Miley feedin' me sandwiches for my stamina
And Santa's in the back laughin' cause my back's crampin' up
Mrs. Claus trippin' balls, think she had enough
And by enough I mean we dope as fuck, she had a gram of us

Calling My Spirit,rap,Kodak Black,2018,"[Verse 1]
I put my heart in my lyrics
I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

[Chorus]
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits
[Verse 2]
I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I’m from we don’t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon
Thuggin', so fuck your opinion
I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feeling
I'm calling my spirit
[Chorus]
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious

(Ah, look)
I said I’m up writing all my wrongs
Think about it all night long
Ndixolele ngezayizolo
I’m a sinner, yeah, that I know
I might get lost but I talk to God
And at times it feel like I’m on my own
I may fall but I get back up
And I always find my way back on
Cause this road can get lengthy and wild
It’s cold to a mother with child and though she’s not losing her faith
The devil may tempt her to try
It’s worse for the girl on the street
Selling her soul to survivе cause mom wasn’t there to advisе
And pops wasn’t there to provide
I Know pain and sadly no man’s above it
Most of us try to numb it
Some of us even love it
That’s why she conceals the scars on her wrists when she’s out in public
It don’t matter who you were
Look after who you’re becoming
[Pre-Chorus: Kid Tini]
At times I just can’t, help but wonder why this world can get so cold
Why the good can die so young, while the evil grow so old
And the truth remains untold but there’s a twist lo and behold
We will rise and we will conquer, even if it takes a toll and that’s on God

[Verse 2: Kid Tini]
School’s an option for many, mainly for those who afford it
You sent your kid to a good one cause’ it’s of utmost importance
He got exposed to the drugs, liquor
The cool kids are on it
“It’s just a doobie c’mon take it nigga, you know you want it”
Now there goes all that potential, what you thought was essential
Groomed an addict now that high the only thing on his mental
Same place that could preserve his future, grant a life of employment
Went and gave him all the necessary tools to destroy it
And so the story goes, tales the streets of Jozi told
Some be ballin’ some be fallin like they caught the Holy Ghost
Life’s like a tutorial, we only hole to live and learn
Buckle up, enjoy the ride and pray that you don’t crash and burn
[Pre-Chorus: Kid Tini]
At times I just can’t, help but wonder why this world can get so cold
Why the good can die so young, while the evil grow so old
And the truth remains untold but there’s a twist love and behold
We will rise and we will conquer, even if it takes a toll and that’s on God

Gun is tucked under this Fendi

Got me in my feelings for the last time
I gave you my heart but you ain't see the shine
Come to think about it, you was never really mine
I used to tell you everything that came up in my mind
And you couldn't keep it real with me when you had the time
And all the lies i can recite every single line
I kept it real no matter how you would've feel about it
And all this love you told me you couldn't live without it
You was my sunshine now my days is getting clouded
And all these demons in my visions, I won't speak about it
Middle finger to 'em tell them get the fuck about it

Remember when you told me you would never ever change
So why you throw me in the dirt and leave me in the flames
I would've died for you and give you everything
And if you needed me you know that i would've came
Could'a gave you a diamond ring
But you was never 'bout me you was only 'bout the game
I don't wanna hear it see all you tell is lies
You tell me that you love me when you look me in the eyes
But then you turn around and started fuckin' other guys
And it's not the first time so i'm really not surprised
But im'a make you learn since you wanna play with fire
Im'a make it burn

So all the time I spend its on chasing ends
Trying to buy my great grandkid a house
So I can say I got him even when I'm out
That's the only thing that matters to me now
Pay no mind to the heathen cause they only talk and shout
Put a drive on the reason ain't no stopping till I said so
Gotta turn these tracks into peso

Amazing Grace,rap,Rick Ross,2015,"[Intro]
Regardless of how it goes down, life goes on, am I right?
Am I right? Am I right?
Just the way I've conditioned my mindset
For me to stand position well, I can survive

[Verse 1]
Living a life of crime is nothing you should glamorize
When seeing your mother smile you had to fantasize
But now it's jellyfish in all the fish tanks
So rich, think what's on a nigga wrist fake
Ain't Jewish, thank jewelers for Frank Muellers
Tenth grade,  Mac 11s, they ain't schoolers
Taught us to think foolish, degrade women
Call all the bitches hoes, still amazed with them
Corner educated, codeine medicated
Every night we celebrated cause we elevated
I am Michael Tyson, Robin Givens in the wind
She knocking at the door, don't let that devil in
Ordered her room service, caviar and cannabis
She ordered the nose candy with the candles lit
Am laid back, status of a Corleone
Screaming Maybach with my Yellow Rollie on
[Chorus]
All my watches designer, all my women designer
Simple gifts from the Gods, I pray you all pray for survival
Smiling in your face, Mac 11 on his waist
Make or break your day better, say your amazing grace
Now you beefing with motherfuckers you never heard of
It's just another hurdle, they wanna see you murdered
Or back to flippin' burgers, better bust your burners
Say my amazing grace, before they reach they a verdict

[Verse 2]
Hey hells kitchen burning me a bell pepper
Minus the lady, P.I. 80 cuz it smells better
Say my amazing grace, she says it's just a phase
Unless it's sustained, am not in this for fame
Minus the hoe shit, the most 'emo-shit'
Versace, Neils, 60 mils selling blow shit
Coudn't make a layer, labelled a brick layer
Pull up at the park in the six, player
Six speed all the fares they can follow
Am at the Delano, ﻿where my model mulatto
Turn the strip club into an arcade
For a coin you could play dem broads, broad day
Get them junkies blowing before I master Donkey Kong
Shit was funny till I started bringing money home
Still think it's a game, aim at your high score
Call it a rap beef, bitch I'm down to die for it
[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
All my watches designer
All my women designer
They wanna see you murdered
Better bust your burner
That's all I know, got a feeling

Now I want two hundred and ménage in my palace
Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance
Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish
'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish
When we fucked again, she told me ""That was just some foul shit""

I Could Write a Rhyme,rap,Celph Titled & Buckwild,2010,"[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
(Y'all got Celph Titled questions?) I got Celph Titled answers
On how I started, how I represent Tampa
I know you're used to hearin' me on some wild-out shit
Yellin' at the top of my lungs how my nine gon' spit
But I got more styles that's sick
And I been doin' this for Fahrenheit 813
Since '93 I been makin' beats and writin' rap sheets
Mischevious teenager with a creative outlet to release anger
Booty shake, bass music, I was into that
Poison Clan, 2 Live Crew, that's what got me into rap
Loopin' tracks with fast hi-hats and 808s
4-track machine with the high-speed cassette tape
Now keep in mind I was a fan, but as MC's we all are
And very few of us become stars
Went from blastin' Magic Mike to grabbin' a mic
Tried to sound like Spice 1 and not Rapper's Delight
E-40 to Ice Cube
The west coast had a lot to do with the type of beats I'd write to
But still the Juice Crew was one of my faves
Never discriminated, whether New York or LA
And around the mid '90s
I became fascinated with the Lord Finesse style of slick rhymin'
The Redmans, the Big L's, the Das EFX's
Ras Kass and Chino XL type of records
(So guess what?) Celph Titled emerged
Bowling ball style, runnin' through pens, author of murderous words
And I was set to rip every verse I put down
17 years old and at rappin' I'm pretty good now
[Hook]
""I could write a rhyme, flip it up and write a next one""
""I could write a rhyme, flip it up and write a next one""
""I could write a rhyme, flip it up and write a next one
Right on the spot, right on the spot""
""I could write a rhyme, flip it up and write a next one""
""I could write a rhyme, flip it up and write a next one""
""I could write a rhyme, flip it up and write a next one
Right on the spot, right on the spot""

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
I'm from a city that don't have much hip-hop roots
So I felt compelled to form a hip-hop group
See, I was once on some go against the norm
Flow fast and write rhymes in complex forms
It was kinda ill at the time
'Cause really the only other choice
Was Puffy and Mase and them Big Willie club joints
So I got my act together
And eventually met two other MC's that rapped together
We was all on that underground vibe
Cella Dwellas, Kool Keith, Tribe and Organized
I was kinda out of my mind, a weird guy
Cut designs in my facial hair, fucked around with beard dye
It was me, Majik and Dutch and we had a lotta fun
Thought we were smart, named ourselves Equilibrium
And had a label called Atomik
With Walkmen and Kramtronix layin' down cuts on it
I stayed pollyin' 24-7
And in 1997 started recording our first record
Then my phone rang, didn't know who it was from
Some guy that called himself Apathy the Alien Tongue
Heard I had production and I could rhyme, too
He was from the north and knew some Jedi Mind dudes
Plus he had a crew better than any squad
Couple months later they was callin' me a Demigod
I started shoppin' my demo aggressively
Landed on the desk of BUDS Distribution NYC
Next thing you know I got a single on wax
And a offer for a job in New York, so my bag was packed
[Hook]
""I could write a rhyme, flip it up and write a next one""
""I could write a rhyme, flip it up and write a next one""

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
Now I'm 19 and a Floridian in New York
White Cuban boy that says 'nigga' and eats pork
So you could call me foul, but back then I didn't care
I would do whatever to catch a listener's ear
So I submerged myself in the local scene
Nuyorican, Wetlands, Tramps, Speed, SOB's
That guy Apathy, he's from Connecticut
So we would link up and write songs to make records with
The label I was messin' with, they was feelin' it
So then we had vinyl distribution at our fingertips
This Demigodz onslaught was in full motion
20 singles in 2000 with no promotion
My name was everywhere, for beats and for features
But best believe I had a fuckload of non-believers
Masterminded an underground persona
Dirty mouth punchline wild animal down to bring the drama
I made a lotta friends from Boston to Philly
Never thought this many heads would say they're really feelin' me
So you gotta respect that
And when Vinnie Paz asked me to join the Army I was like ""Bet that""
Then Jimmy Iovine's assistant insisted
That me and Apathy make a little visit for business
The deal fell through, but Atlantic picked Ap up
We expanded the Godz in LA with more rappers
Then Cage got smacked up, I remember punchin' him
I remember pressin' up his diss songs and trumpin' him
I remember havin' him so scared
Chain smokin' in the backroom at his show just 'cause I was there
He was drugged up and panicked
Couldn't face me, he was frantic
Snuck behind with a bottle and then he ran quick
That's how a little man fights a giant
Cowardly lyin' and God strike me down if I'm lyin'
But I've moved past that, it's all gravy
I was on an album executively produced by Jay-Z
Tours with Mike Shinoda, gettin' paper with Fort Minor
My worldwide exposure is a sore reminder
To those who think I'm gonna disappear
But it's pretty obvious that I ain't goin' nowhere
I am a hater's worst nightmare that got fans
And I gain more and more everytime I drop jams

Used to get my chickens from Tijuana
So I been fucking with the Migos
Yeah nigga it’s killing season, I’m paid in full, I’m rico
They tryna hit me with the R.I.C.O, but I’m lowkey with them kilos
That 8-Ball's fat as Cee-Lo ‘til they barged in like Chico
They ain’t find shit but Nemo, had to take a break like free throws
You ain’t get your dick sucked today, that’s no neck, Benzino
Left eye in that peephole, got me sipping all on this Clicquot
Niggas feel they Debo, put the Glock nine in your ego
Yeah I grew up whipping the baking soda
Had to shave an onion just to make my quota
I was playing ball, knocked out a cop
Can’t talk about it ‘cause the case is open
Business a game ‘til the rape is open
Two desert Eagles, that’s chain smoking
Yeah, niggas bark like niggas hard
But wanna sue a nigga when his face swollen
Hammer on 'em,  too legit, Maserati with the kit
I got 20-20 vision, I see diamonds on my wrist
I see mami with the shit, and she pop it while she strip
Everybody taking shots, I’m 2Pac up on the strip, nigga

Me And My Dick Fap Anthem,rap,Sensei (US),2013,"[Verse 1]
It was seventh grade when I began to play
During my suspended days
Discovered pornhub and since then I've never been the same
Crispy socks and wasting lotion, jerking is my favorite motion
Take my porn away and I'll kill myself by overdosing
The first video was lesbian big titty hoes
I was fascinated by their use of a double dildo
Young age so I just came some clear stuff
But it was clear enough that this would be a hobby for years to come
Ninth grade I was jacking off daily
My girl Alexis Texas became my favorite lady
Watching that ass bounce was really fucking amazing
Got me cumming tsunamis, I almost drowned in my babies
Started watching interracial all the way to the facial
From a good throatfucking to a brutal anal
White girls on a black dick made me happy when I was fapping
Got me thinking that my fantasies could really happen
Being a virgin got me hurtin' but it's ok cause my dick and hand are
Here for certain
Being a virgin got me hurtin' but it's ok cause my dick and hand are
Here for certain
[Hook X4]
Just me and my dick, my dick
Just me and my dick, my dick
Just me and my dick

[Verse 2]
In tenth grade I began to put weed in the equation
I learned that being high equals great masturbation
Got a high from an edible, sensation was incredible
Busted off a balcony in Boise
I fear it being noisy when I jack off but I never back off
I get aroused so easily but try to act soft
I can't wait until I'm eighteen to buy a fleshlight
Hopefully soon I get a chance to figure out what sex like
But till then I'll just beat off
And make sure that I keep socks
In the vicinity to begin to clean shit I skeet on
This the anthem, lube ya damn hands up
This the anthem, lube ya damn hands up

Untouchable,rap,Eminem,2017,"[Part I]

[Intro]
Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...
[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...
[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live

Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Part II]

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty ‘cause we're black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"" that made people slaves to build",891336,887

Wake up roll up take a bong rip, hold up
No stress no sticks no stems no seeds
Blow up more sluts, d-dank weed
It's Friday and these are the daily habits
Stroke a slut, grope her butt throw away the magnums
Crack a cup, coconut I'm just lampin'
Chillin' in the cut, dodge magnum
Troubles in your life, zombies be the answer
Smokin' all day probably got throat cancer

Bright and early in the morning liquor in my guts
The homie on the phone and my niggas say wassup
Roll up on the ave, locs on black

Take her titty on out we fixin' to go out
Ashes and dutch guts keep it on the hush hush

Focus on the top sky scraper

I motivate mines
Played up on the sideline, I gotta take time

Cash up in my prime packin' laughter in my rhymes
Smokin' chokin' rolled eleven times
And you got me on the ropes
Stop light weed turn green like the hulk
And I breathe when I smoke

Weed smoke lethal, Juice go hard, Erick Arc how we do
And meech be the beast too, you rap dudes sea food
Life after death every minutes on the hour
It's a war goin' on everybody want the power
Money be the mission, dope by the kitchen
Purp by the pound, this rap game different
Leave the beat wet like Meth was in his prime
Doped the fuck out three xans, four lines

Half a key serve it by the OZ

You ain't even figure that i'm Usain Bolt going on a little run tryna track my thoughts

Ain't no simp no bitch I live just keep them drugs and guns for me
Ain't tryna Kurt Cobain myself, too much to give on up

And this rap shit might hold me down, so I just live it up

Sekou Story,rap,Nas,2004,"[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red Ferrari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, ""Nas, roll with us""
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Dawn, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him ""Here keep that""
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
*beat changes*
She said
[Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X]
""Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now""

[Nas as Scarlett]
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on Biscayne, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a ho has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all

Shad Fer - Freestyle,rap,Shad Fer,2014,"[Verse 1:Mathematics]

Say hello to the terror,no Care Bear or Telly Tubby
I embarrass dummies,clearly above that elementary flow
Military mode is as friendly as I go
Cause I know from that land where folks who laugh at ya jokes
Still get smoked,they gave me a book,they gave me a pencil I wrote
Some fly notes,to tell the folks at home exactly what I know
That I’m broke
And yet my eyes are focused on that designer black and white coat
So I approach this with my heart in my art
But I’m smart enough to know that those this dope should get dough
Spit that crack like what homeless smoke on the low
This strictly facts,realer than all the crap
The government don’t show and won’t show
Because they’re scared of turning  their friends into foes
How you supposed to tell them that the guns are from us
The drugs are from us
The popo smokin' dope that they bust
So in half in the mic splits,don’t have to write this
Flying higher than them astronauts lift
For my niggas on the block gettin profit off the rock
You could do what you want,just know that karma’s on the watch
Haunt you when you on the move,haunt when you stop
That’s how you know what to do and what do not do
Screw cops,especially if they ladies get em wetter than a dew drop
Tsunami when they spot the millions you make off a few knots
They’ll forget their old career and come and ask you for a new job
Just stick around for now,keep your mouth zip-a-dee-doo-da
Sounds like a lot of hoopla!
[Verse 2:Nosetalgia]

I’m evolved,singing c-notes
Immigrants speaking creole
I ain’t judging no people
Just strictly living the g code
Niggas is dealing kilos imported from Puerto Rico
Snitches get stitches,in order to warn you they kill your Lilos
Bullets in your gut and your gullet,no need to reload
The bureau only look at the Coloreds and the Latinos
That’s why we use caucasions as puppets so we could keep low
Ducking under the covers but treated like El Padrino
Al Pacino,get deniro wherever we go
We speak the lingo,dollars with commas after the 3 zeros
Pop collars,pop bottles,swap models and mingle
But could leave you face paler than a sour cream Pringle
Seated in the king’s thrown
Feeling bigger than king kong’s ding dong
Amongst these um,niño pequeños
And when I die bury me is inside the deepest side of your mind
Speak of my life and times like I was really regal
Flyer than a seagull seated on top of an eagle
Sharper than my katana,flow swift like speedboat
Honor fathers and mamas,just so your days could be long
Upon the land and forest the Lord giveth your people
Plan to make the largest of harvests after my seeds grow
Definition of evil
Combined with whatever defines and describes
Justice and equality for my negros
The crackspots ain't really too far away from cathedrals
So what you gonna be,the heroine or the hero
What you gonna do dawg,sell it buy it or freeload
Fantasize bout these hoes who take your money,jewelry,clothes
You lose,shouldn’t be surprised by what the court’s jury votes
[Verse 3:Flava In Ya Ear]
Shaddy got the new flava in ya ear
Dropping bombs and blowing up
I’m like Al Quaeda in an air plane
But a little more urban,don’t rock a turban
Don’t have to off myself for seventy two virgins
Verbally hurting verses satisfies my urges
The mastermind could tell you practiced child
But you ain't learning
Yearning for them worthless materials I’ll be earning
Add more zeros to the cost and I could still afford to purchase
It’s the mc,shogun,real Gs don’t show guns
Just tote one and totally toe tagging who ever want some
Y'all the niggas who would kill em in the spur in the moment
Wake up with the sickness of a girl giving birth in the morning
Cursing and moaning,groaning
Dawg I should’ve spared him or warned him
He appearing in my nightmares,blood on my air jordans
My dear daughter,sadly no daddy to care for ya
Cause the snitches in the prison already talked to the warden
Ain’t calling no names,so don’t worry fella
I’m just storytelling
Edward in the flesh,biting all of your bellas
Never swelling her belly,father figure is jealous
But can’t ever ever tell us why we cannot be together
It’s the bestest,bestest,you best request protection
The concept of contraceptives is suggesting
That my weapons will shred skin
It’s true,I can win,to lose
Would be 2pac admitting to biggie
That he ain't got the juice in 2002
[Verse 4:American Dreamin']
No soy Americano,yo soy de las Bahamas
If it’s a trigger and pull it,no one’s bullet hit could harm us
Questing for the dollars made me smart enough
To answer every question on the test
No second guessing man no problem
Just cause you blessed
Don’t mean you get to expect tomorrow
If I meet Tia today by tonight I’ll be with Tamara
In between the sun and stars
My women addiction getting stronger
Want em all and to deny any would be dishonor
Life cannot be wasted,yall be complaining,unhappy with ya placements
Then change ya arrangements,hate it when I’m caged in
A spectator’s basement,I act like an animal and haters say I’m dangerous
Man I cannot blame them,escape this and shame them
Became who I am through strictly sweat and dedication
The manifestation of greatness,my train’s at the staition
You the definition of defecation
Uneducated,calling em racist
Just cause they don’t expect you to do something amazing
Snatching chains and grabbing the matching ring
Drug lord captain and feeling like you a king
Could trace it back to slavery
Except we the ones who selling white now
And they the ones who think that we crazy
Think that we lazy,expect us to leave our lady
And never take care of babies,everybody wanna be a Lebron,Kobe or KD
To drive in that Mercedes feeling cooler than an AC
That's to negative to 80 degrees,what’s your major
You ain’t even care for degrees,signed to major labels
Screw music,you came for the cheese
You gained it with ease,sleeping,taking your Zs
Your grades were diseased,famous for just for making the 3s
That made for up the Ds
But that explains why the nigga working hard in his office has a reason be
Dreamin',dreamin',to be like you,it ain’t fair nigga but what can I do

[Verse 5:Man Of The Year]
Somebody better get a new speaker
Cause you about to see the boy beat the beat up
Even with the drinks right next to the reefer
I could still set the bar high on meter
Tell a broad ""hi"" like I wanna meet her
Spotted her from far and I could see that she a freak bruh
Only cause she foreign dawg,I think that I'ma keep her
Cause I need a translator to speak to señoritas
But I’ll never ever know
When I’ll end up dead in my bed alone
And I really haven’t been in this battle long
So I’m tryna make sure that get along
With dudes that would shoot deuce deuce
Like they shooting hoops
Maybe I could learn some new moves
Pick up a platoon of new troops
Separate and barricade the tuna from the barracuda group
Man every nigga tryna win,some in and out of penitentiary
At elementary level when they entered
From the second they left that placenta
The agenda was to become a part of the percentage
Of the niggas doing dumb stuff to get respected
You sleepin' on the real as if you’re interesting
I’m a mirror nigga,I could get bit reflective
If you don’t like what you see,you better switch perspectives
Get exactly what you wish for with a different method
Why play the game just to get ejected
Hope you idiots remember the kid who said this
Can’t blame a simple minded nigga if he forgets quick
I’m a complex starch,takes a while digest this
Bout to rape the game nigga,straight up molest it
As wild as I get,my style is perfected
You must dislike music if you decide to reject this

[Verse 5:Girls Love Beyonce]

See I know girls love Beyonce
She independent but naughty
They wanna marry fiances
But I’m still shopping for thotties
Ain’t into spending my money
Just want that sugar and honey,mmm
Too sweet to eat
Lips have a flavor that a cake can’t can’t beat
It’s amazing when I taste that treat
Face,cheeks,legs,hands,meet
Eggs can’t beat to make this pastry
But the heart go boom da da doom doom,racing,chasing me
So your legs get weak,so I sweep your feet
Just in case you needed it,this just the way that we speak
Know we gonna meet same place next week
This ain’t love so don’t throw in no emotion
You’ll just get heartbroken
So don’t leave your door open for a stranger like me
You ain't the wifey,she say I know how it is Shad,you don’t have to remind me
Say my name,say my name,when no one is around you
You know that I’ll find you to just take up some space
Say my name,say my name,I like the way you pronounce it
Twerk it,baby,bounce it,when you hear my music play
Baby sing,baby sing,when you hear my music play",4265,87479
Breathe Me,rap,OnCue,2012,"(Intro)
Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And, the worst part is there's no one else to blame
Be my friend
Hold me, wrap me up
Unfold me, I am small
I'm needy, warm me up
And breathe me

(Verse 1)
My inner demons are dreaming
Of scheming a plot of treason
To the reason I believe in
Since I was a semen
I was birthed in the evening
So by tomorrow morning I will be leaving
I’m going never looking back
I never held a gun
Never ever cooked crack
So I gotta go and get 'em on the flip side
Please believe homeboy, man I’ll get by
I said why they don't believe me
That I’m a genius
This is an experiment
I’m the fucking chemist
How you gon' match that
Music is a hamster in a wheel
And you, you are the lab rat
And it's so beautiful
When we gon' realize me and you could rule the world
Intertwine, unfurl, tryna get all these girls
Money, diamonds, and pearls
That shit I dont give a fuck about
Im just tryna run my mouth
Tryna run this out
(Chorus)
Ouch I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah I think that I might break
I've lost myself again and I feel unsafe

(Verse 2)
I tell her, ""I'mma go hard.""
She like, ""Take it easy.""
I’m like ""Are you kidding?"" jk I’m like, ""Please.""
She like, ""Don’t go
No, don’t leave.""
She asks, ""Do you have a heart?""
I wear it on my sleeve
I’m tryna hit the road
You scream, ""Don’t go""
Pulling on my arm, telling me no
Well if this ain’t enough then I really don’t know
I said if this ain’t enough then I really don’t know
See I’m tryna get the dough
For me and my momma
Tryna rise above all this pain and this drama
But this ain’t finished, let's end it with a comma
Don’t change your number in a few months I might holla
Man fuck college
I’m tryna make a dollar
Can't see my papa, so I can't be a scholar
I don’t even kid, they see it
Scholars don’t make history
They just read it
Why don’t they believe this?

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rap diablo
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's the rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
The bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho, rockin' shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me, I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my G-pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em
Tryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium
Fools I pity 'em, I'm not a human, I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men, I ain't savin' nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels comin', skippin' all the famous functions
How do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted
I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me, then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich, this is piracy (Piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fuckin' eyes to see
Come and die with me

Yeah, um
Okay, my mind is Yoda, I'm on Ayatollah
These other rappers just a diet soda
I find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements
This a marathon, gentlemen, go 'head and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
You'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin', now you on vacation
Rappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas
Lava makin', so hot I'm turnin' hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial
I been poppin' like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal
Treat you like a urinal

Still OmenXIII, black shirt, black jeans

But the money can't make me happy so I spend it how I will
'Cause we all gotta die in the end, that's real
Yeah we all get spilled, yeah we all get dumped
So I live my fucking life every day like I want
Moving gas, I copped the sack, I call it gas money
Ain't no tracking, never slacking, dine and dash, running
That's how I'm feeling when I'm moving through these streets
Come through your city, tear it down and then we feast
I used to think that life was only what it was made
But now I know that life can still be what you make it
Within reason, every season brings change
Sometimes you to have to learn to turn the fucking page, aye
Death stands still, life moves on
I be smoking blunts at night and when I die I just respawn
Logging to it, I got admin rights into the system

Decay,rap,Fabvl,2020,"[Verse 1 (DizzyEight)]
Had good in my heart, now it's darkness
I lost my light, made me heartless
I had to part with all of the people I walked with
Friends turn to enemies, now I'm the target
Out of my mind, they think that I lost it
When Izuna died, man, I lost it
Everything changed when I lost him
I had to put my brother in a coffin

I got a plan for the land, they don't see that
I want peace, but it seems it can't be that
They don't see what I see, I can't make 'em believe
If I gotta be a villain, I'll be that
Tried to kill me off, but death I cheat that
Never truly gone, just hit the reset
I just hit a level you ain't reached yet
Stand inside my way, you get deleted

Tsukuyomi put the world in a trance
All of this was just apart of the plans
Victory what I saw in advance
Now I got the whole world in my hands
Legendary you didn't know, yeah
No Shikamaru leave 'em froze, yeah
Would've thought they just seen ghost, nope
All you're seeing is a G.O.A.T

If it justifies the means I'll let my heart get cold
This is the road that I chose
I'mma see it through, no matter who's head gotta roll

Built this city that you claim
Think it's time to leave

Bring the thunder and the rain

Are bound to wither now

I've been betrayed, I've been betrayed
It's alright, I'll own the night
'Till you decay, 'till you decay

[Verse 2 (FabvL)]
I am the legend unspoken
Sharingan has been awoken
Hashirama came to split the common
So I'm spilling the blood like an ocean
Pledge allegiance to the broken
Break me down and call it coping
Wound was severed, now the peace is lost
Knew it'd be the cost, so I'm hoping
Everybody wanna have the fire inside
Until the fire inside has gone cold
See the anger well up, it's one hell of a rise
Uchiha veteran kind, I'm not home
Who you gonna be?
Leader of the clan or a flea?
Guessing when it's time, we'll see
Bow to your king
Deal with the devil and I'll make you plea
I'm a whole different breed

Never seen nothing but suffering
I've had enough it
Gonna make all of you pay
Sage of Six Paths coming with the wrath
Burn every leaf until all you decay
I am the way, I am the light
""Madara Madara"", pray for your life
Rinnegan gaze, cuts like a knife
Bring the shinobi and give me a fight

But at the end, I'm guessing we'll see
Who took control? Who did I mold?
Who was I planning to be?
Selling my soul, breaking the mold
People that mattered would leave
Was I too bold? Heart wasn't full
Maybe the problem was me

Got too cool, and I lost count of my blessings

Miss the minimum that’s absolute
My money ain’t discontinuous but it still jump like a parachute
They try to copy me like graph reflection
‘Cause I’m makin waves like a sine function
My stacks so fat they in 3 dimensions
So I cubed the thang and found the cross section
I’m in calc 2 no math rookie
And i school these kids like my names goodly
But my students best not get pushy
Or I'll crack 'em open like a fortune cookie

Doing math on a beat
Run a tangent on degree

Yo, fucking Paulie TRYBE, man
Get your muthafucking hand out her asshole
We gotta go, fam, we gotta go, kid
Yo, get the whip, get the whip!

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]

I'll take 21st Century poets that's for a thousand
Curly hair or Nubian women get me aroused
To the point I wanna gamble it all
I was smashing from the back
She put her hands on the wall
She couldn't take the thrust
Only lust like a fiend for the dust
Or the pizza from Pezzi, perfect
Want to sleep with the crust
Or the 740 Alpina, leather seats is a must
And my shorty holding a nina
Rolling green in a duuuuuuuuuutch!
Bronsolini, organically I rise to paper
In the purest form, lyrically derived from nature
Like the Amazon, put your cameras on
Watch this muthafucka turn into an animal!
Light stubble, rock the muzzle like Hannibal
Jump off the top of the boat into a cannonball
Hoes with gold teeth, we off the coast of Greece
In under 3 seconds, muthafucka load the piece
Kid, the bag of money coming with me
You muthafucka
The bag of money coming with me
Yeah, the bag of money's coming with me
Muthafucka you

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]

Surprise! Lauren is in the house
I eat fowl birds and keep a hen inside my mouth
Always extra, guest featuring with Dr. Lecter
Like Bald Head Slick, I hold my mic like a scepter
Rest in peace, Guru, son I rep Q-U
Chains on chunk
They looking at me like ""who you?!""
These handmade Cubans probably fucking up my posture
Pesto sauce properly drizzled upon my pasta
No imposter, son I'm authentic
Around drugs so much, I'm probably raw scented
Bag of money dips, triceps is all dented
Precise painting pictures
Think about life and then I pen it
Nike Air extraordinaire, it’s a cold world, prepare
That’s what it is, dad
Winterize your vehicle
I love kicks like Action Bronson loves a reefer pull
Peace to good, bad girls that let us both sleep with you
The bag of bitches coming with me
Word up, son, all the bitches coming with me
Yeah, yo, the bag of bitches coming with me
We go raw son, all the bitches coming with me!

We making babies tonight, nigga
Yeah, smoke what you want, sniff what you want
You wanna have five daddies, you ever have five daddies before?

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]

Ayo, 2010, got ‘em buzzing like a beeper
Round table discussion
Conference in Geneva
Leaders at the table, poly over nasal
Forty seven minutes since the time I lit the basil
My rhymes are carte blanche
Liver than the Oscars
Extra virgin olive oil drizzled on the pasta
Fry the bacon, make it sizzle for the chazers
Honor in this thing of ours
Living like the mobsters
Compliments go to the chef and that’s the real
My crew of goonies in the joint
We need some extra veal
You know the Caddy got an extra wheel
And if I’m ever in a pickle, I can hand a fucking Tek to Steele
Take aim and knock an apple off your head
And I’m a play like Polamalu
You get tackled for the bread
We’re running in your crib
Your shorty shackled to the bed
Money laying on the Persian
Leaking plasma from the lead
And it’s on!

No tint on the window, still can't see if I'm in it
Cause my seat back low, and my car full of smoke
Can't stop for them bitches, tryna get in this dough
Chandelier these ceilings, Italian marble these floors
From my one bedroom apartment who knew where I would go
I didn't pay they cut my lights they pay me now I light up shows
Ridin' round in my Rolls, in my terrycloth robes
Various hoes is plotting to get carried over thresholds
But I'm already married, me and this paper we so mofuckin' happy together
I swear I was good but it made me better
Paved the way for the capital letter, B
Stoned like a statue of me perpetually
Let me roll

If you talking 'bout hitting a lick then count me in
If you talking 'bout selling some pills then count me in

If you talking 'bout selling some piff then count me in
If you talking it's gon' get me rich quick then count me in
If you talking 'bout stacking some chips then count me in

No stranger to this danger rolling with my Mac-11

Bone crusher, I'm like the hood's top celebrity
Long dick ya chick like my rap's longevity
Colder than a glass of ice cubes
I got 'em all in bad moods, stompin' on shoes, I never lose
I don't give a fuck about how you're feelin'
Got the roof on fire, legs to the ceilin'
Sexual healin', we throw on that Marvin Gaye shit
Got two black burners, that'll melt your facelift
Memory foam muffle the sound of the gun blast
My clan bring heat like the summer, check the forecast
We kamikazes, microphone aeronautics
We bounce off promoters like West Coast hydraulics
Narcotics, we keep a stash in the gun box
Right near the mask and the wig are the fake dreadlocks
Bumboclaat, box of ammo in the pocket
It's all fun and games 'til your eye's hangin' out your socket

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Watch how you're talkin' to my goons, it's guerillas
Shooters, ruthless, all types of killers
Hunger Game shit, they're fightin' for block space

Lawyers handle problems accordingly
They actin' like they pops wasn't callin' me
I gotta make sure my corner eat
Over the stove pot leaned to the side like I'm pourin' tea
Black man in a foreign V, emblem on the door and seats
Either you a hustler or a thief
All I needed was a quarter ki'
In the corner, me and my dawg regulated like Warren G
Sold it hot, but I bought it cheap
Got it from Miami back to P.A. like Ross and Meek
Huh, borrowed your bitch for a week
She hold my guns and bricks, I give her dick for a storage fee
You talk slick, but can't afford to be
And we don't call it beef until I'm sendin' hits where your daughters be
Step on work with foreign sneaks
Everything foreign so my bitch look like Kimora Lee

The nozzle is the nostril of the Roscoe, pop pop!
Possibly I'm comin' across as hostile
You could be double-crossed by your apostle, that's the Pentecostal gospel
Black C.O.B. flag hangin' out the left side
Blowin' in the atmosphere, the atlas here is Westside
Ran up in the stash spot when I heard my connect died
His wife is Columbian, got Columbian neck tied
I went from roaches in the cereal to flowin' the most ferocious in your stereo
But culture vultures don't hear me though
Hotter than diseases that overdose the venereal
While bitches out here with a burnin' bush like the Moses miracle
Why the fuck would I touch a thot with some gonorrhea?
I give her the hammer, I call it a blammer, that's onomatopoeia

Still walking down the streets with my hand on my black Tec
My brain is high like Newark New Jersey do car thefts
I'm high, when I sag my 2 Black Guys
I would be brief but my Karl Kani's didn't dry
I smoke the blunt for all you underground chumps
My smoke bangs like it's freshly picked from the swamps
So nigga how you roll a blunt, how you roll a blunt
Flip the script on some other shit like how you roll a cunt
Now, I smoke the Maui, wow-wee
Then I'll be back for more, I'm sure, like Al B
Go Uptown, smoke quarter-pounds at the Dungeon
Keith Murray meets me at the spot with the Bom-Ba
Go back to Jerz and smoke with Diezel Don
Huh, pick up a bag from my block, two-oh's the number
Who can get swift with the microphonics
Plus I'm crisp like CD's on LP's in 3D
My funk respect it, cosmic injected
That cause me to set it off just like that club record
Hit it from the back, stay strapped like two packs of lubricants
It's gonna hurt, no it's not I got experience
The funk dweller, creeps through your cellar
And if your moms don't know your ass better tell her, like this y'all
[Verse 2: Redman]
There's a million and one blunt spots all over the world
That got the good herb for all you boys and girls
Which one do you go to?
Which one do you go to?
I'm packing buddha by the pounds and pull my Phillies from knapsacks
Hey bro I didn't know your nickel bags come that fat
Yo check it, my lyrics strip the track butt-naked
Catch the local to the A to the buddha to my vocals
And I, set the world on fire
Get a billion people higher, from just one blunt in my cypher
You'd swear the ganja was mixed in bom-ba-zee
The rhymer bomb squads and MC's like Hank Shocklee
I spend a knot at all the buddha spots
From fifteen to fifty-fifth I ran all through the blocks
I set it off jock, I light a blunt for my nigga D
That's doing three flat, now where I get the hash at
You can't fuck with my funk cause my funk is kinda abstract
Past that, my stuff, I'm rough like McGruff on dust
There's a million and one blunt spots in America
Yeah I'm tellin ya

[Verse 3: Redman]
Now just throw your blunts up in the motherfucking air
Smoked out with niggas from North Newark to Montclair
I rip the nouns from antonyms to synonyms
Cause I got soul like James Brown and Rakim and them
One of the America's Most Blunted
Smoked out with MC Eiht and Compton Most Wanted
Ninety degrees, smoke with L.O.D. on the Island
Then back to Stat, to smoke more packs with the Shaolin
I showed the women how to roll a blunt stronger
But it didn't work because they Lee nails got longer
But the weed is good for when you're macking
And girls can front it off like they don't know shit that happened
I know what happened, I told her back, nick that motherfucker
So check my stamina, your ass couldn't snap with cameras
Leave you on your back like Godzilla did Gamera
Props on blocks smoking the choc and what-nots
I might catch a nickel bag sale from bus stops",5074,79098

Sober Thoughts,rap,Young M.A,2019,"[Intro: Max YB]
Oh, nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah, ya-yeah

[Verse 1: Young M.A.]
Disciplinin' my habits, went distant on my attachments
I had to turn my presence to absence
Stuck in a cage, questionin' the hours and days
Depressional phase, my tunnel vision startin' to fade
I started to marry my thoughts, already engaged
Not knowing my next move had me going insane
Depending on alcohol to get me over the pain
Praying my habit don't ever have me turn to cocaine
I won't allow this temporary pain to turn to a stain
I wanna live but my joy for life is stuck in the grave
God I need you more than ever, I was hoping you came
So used to holdin' shit in, it's kinda hard to explain
Picasso the best way to put it
Before you knew the meaning of it, you misunderstood it
Far from perfect, did a lot of shit I knew I shouldn't
Duckin' my demons but they comin' like a movin' bullet
Shit, it's crazy out here, it's like I love it and I hate it out here
Gotta be mentally stable out here, just to make it out here
Never slippin', everyday I'm aware
If I ain't got it, I'll go get it, and I'll make it appear
Tough love, being assertive, that's the way that I care
When I'm distant and I ignore you, then to me you ain't there
When I erase you that's when you worry, replace yo ass in a hurry
That's the truth, not a dare, nigga do not compare
[Chorus: Max YB]
All this pain in me, I want it washed away
I gotta keep faith in me, these niggas want me dead
I gotta stay strong, stay strong
I've been fightin' all my life, oh
May God watch my soul

[Verse 2: Young M.A.]
Only people that think that I fell off is people who wasn't supportin' before the fame and the fortune
My fanbase was already a force and
I was sellin' out shows before the radio sources
Meanin' the grind of independence what got me in it
Not a co-sign or a mention and this is not fiction
Now I'm feelin' attention from muhfuckers that once was dick-lickin', and pic-flickin' friendship
And this isn't no damn fool
I know the game so it's cool
And when you play the game, play it by the rules, uh
Mama ain't raise no coon, I know the difference between loved and used
Life is just hugs and bruises, care and crew
Fuck desire, my heart pump fire, ooh
Don't inhale my fumes, I'm toxic, caged in like zoos
Boxed in like boxin', in the studio locked in
Man you couldn't walk a block in my shoes
Not even my socks, shit
Came from the bottom that's why I fuck with the top shit
I'm talkin' 'bout that never, ever, ever in stock shit
I don't pop shit, I speak knowledge, just call me a prophet
And if you pay attention then you payin' homage
Cheap jeans with paid pockets, this poundcake got these weight watchers weight watchin', uh
I ain't stoppin' like Hov said
Sit in front of the Bentley, with the doors out like bow-legs
I hate a bitch with a fat ass and no legs
I love a bitch with some crack pussy and dope head
Broke bread with niggas, all I got was a thank you
And you got some other niggas out here sayin' they made you, ha
The game tryin' to erase you, got my foot on they necks
You disrespect the tech I'll give you a facial, uh
Apologies to my exes, and no this ain't my confessions
Appreciate your time and investment, patience and effort
Having ya'll was part of a blessin'
Y'all all belong on the cover of Essence
No hard feelings, no love lost
No bad blood, your love is a bad drug
But better to have love than no love
I need a blunt, KorLeone, can you roll one?
And smoke one?
[Chorus: Max YB]
All this pain in me, I want it washed away
I gotta keep faith in me, these niggas want me dead
I gotta stay strong, stay strong
I've been fightin' all my life, oh
May God watch my soul, ah

[Outro: Max YB]
Oh, all these battles I've been fighting
Ooh, all these battles I've been fighting
I just gotta keep on goin' on, on and on, and on, ooh-oh",57677,14626
Focus,rap,Nessly,2016,"[Verse 1]
I never lost focus
I just made 5 thousand in a half hour and I'm not joking
Better ask, angel diamonds on my neck doing osmosis
New Tesla on pre-order
Had to tell all these broke promoters
I need all my money 'fore I leave Georgia
I'm out the country again
Had to finesse the conversion rate
Birkin bag full of bands
I look like I just did a burglary
I made two cups of the red
Right now I feel like I'm walking on Mercury
I cannot trust a new nigga
They wanna run off with the check and do surgery

I ain't losing focus, I ain't getting cozy
I know who my foes is, I know who my bros is

She want my love, my wrists 15 hundred a piece
That's why I'm dissing, this shit been troubling me
Yeah, leech
I'd rather fuck up a check then give a furious speech
Paper make your favorite women pull off her purity ring
Rap game got me praying my children can sing
I'm way too focused on these bands, bitch I'm really in sync
Don't come with commas, then we don't got a reason to link
I see the face of the realest nigga above the sink

I ain't losing focus, I ain't getting cozy
I know who my foes is, I know who my bros is

I never lost focus
I still dodge cobras and walk on roses
Real friends, bitch you ran off on my resource
In the city everybody soulless
In my brain it's raining during winter solstice

I ain't losing focus, I ain't getting cozy
I know who my foes is, I know who my bros is
I know who my bros is, I know who my foes is
I ain't getting cozy, I ain't losing focus

Until the Lion Learns to Speak,rap,K'naan,2004,"[Intro:]
Yo, this one here goes out to the struggle
In the tradition of the old poets
Yo, the nation of poets
We haven't forgotten that
Yo, In the tradition of Careys Ciise Kaarshe
God bless his soul
I want to say something to you, my friends around the mic

[Verse 1:]
Until the lion learns to speak
The tales of hunting will be weak
My poetry hails within the streets
My poetry fails to be discrete
It travels across the earth and seas
From Eritrea to the West Indies
It knows no boundaries
No cheese
It studied in parts of Greece
(runtaa hadii kale waxaan lahaa aaheey)
I am sick as far as lyrics
And with this far as gimmicks
I spit par age and limit
The shit they talk and rip it
I am hip the hop as living
I skip the obvious woman
Don't get what I am presenting
No rims my mind spinning
(runtaa hadii kale waxaan lahaa aaheey)
[Verse 2:]
I was born and raised in a place
Where torn of flame would place
Where the foreigners not embrace
Where they warn you jog and pace
Where loners lower they gaze
Where the corners slow at a chase
Where they tarts and turn in the maze
With the pistol upon your face
(runtaa hadii kale waxaan lahaa aaheey)
So come with me to my longs
The death and deal we run
With passion see how I come
No cash I am free in the slums
The past can we overcome
I am asking we be the ones
To actually be the ones
To free our people from gun

Dear Mama Frank Nitty Remix,rap,2Pac,2007,"[Verse 1: 2Pac]
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
[Hook: Anthony Hamilton & 2Pac]
Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you
(Dear mama)
Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Yo
Man I should run up in these record labels
Like hey let me talk to ya'll
Then put that K to A in R's
Like Im bout to spell Arkansas
Hand over my ice and cream
I ain't talkin about Haagen Dazs
I could moonwalk on the sun
Stop wishin on these fallen stars
Flow sharper than arrow heads
Ask around im a thoroughbred
Best rapper alive
I mean like in the whole world craig
Shout out to my birthplace
Who knew I would lose it all
You could sign me durin a earthquake
This time I would refuse to fall
Cause my swag high like a nigga blew that kush
Kicks fly like I threw a shoe at bush
Whats takin so long to get the radio goin
I feel like a chick gettin ready for prom
No rainbow, but it's so lame though
Here's a quick question for the Los game show
Whos better? You never
Man make a lil room for the new fella
[Hook: Los]
Good loadie woadie, everyone in the hood
Roll up on me like, now whats up witchu homie?
Don't you know all these suckas is phonie?

The town ain't safe cuz the hood just hood
My past couldn't slow a nigga down, what could?
So the crown ain't safe in the hood, whats good?
I know you see me gunnin' for the spot, whats good?
From the bottom I'm comin' for the top, whats good?
Tell em keep your money runnin' til it stops, whats good?
When I get say Im gunnin' for my block, whats good?
Let me tell you what's good
The town ain't safe cuz the hood just hood
My past couldn't slowa nigga down, what could?
So the crown ain't safe in the hood, whats good?

[Verse 2: Los]
I'm just sailin' off and livin' far from frail Or starving prison jail
Ya boy be tight and his jewelry bright
As Baylor, Harvard, Princeton, Yale
What I gotta tell ya like Kanye tell ya
Run up in the woods, pull a Kanye Taylor
Came from the bottom, so you know I hate failure
I make everything tight like Kanye Tailor
Somebody go ask Jay Z
Whats the craziest a flow could be?
Cause I be sayin shit that could make an athiest go O M G

Children of God,rap,Heavy Metal Kings,2011,"[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Never doubt your God, children singing songs about Jihad
Explosions that blow cars over buildings from afar
We the children of a bloodstained revolution
Gun bang, forever shoot and run fam, get your Uzi love thing
Retribution Timberland boots, leather gooses
In the undisclosed black bulletproof with the extra shooter
Bought a box of banana clips from these anarchists
Like Tim Osman commanding the ship on dialysis
More pain more gain, 9/11 was a war game
More enemies, more friends, more fame
Listen to propaganda cock the hammer
We can stop a man but how do you destroy an army that’s a phantom?
How do you kill a militia that’s invisible?
Mystical, peep what official pistols do, kid we invincible
How do you stop the unstoppable, unkillable?
The salvation of God, now sit back and listen to the song y’all

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I heard children sing Allahu Akhbar in Turkey
One had a Russian AK, dirty Iverson jersey
I don’t know if it made me proud or if it disturbed me
I guess it’s not as bad as kids being fucked by the clergy
Kufi on, Glock cocked moving through the palace
A dead Kennedy in California Über Alles
I’ll drink a quart of virgin blood inside a Buddha chalice
I took the head off a Kennedy from the roof in Dallas
Yeah I wish that Ron Paul ran again
If not then I’mma have to take the lead like Jeff Hanneman
(Seasons of the abyss) y’all falling for the trap again
.38 leave your fucking body like a mannequin
Yeah if Billy blast at you I blast with him
We don’t live in a republic, it’s just fascism
The Louvre isn’t a museum, it’s a glass prison
Fuck a class system, listen to the song y’all",8537,57816

Robbin Hood Theory,rap,Gang Starr,1998,"[Intro]
Guru: Peace Brother Elijah
Elijah Shabazz: Hey peace Guru, how you doing?
Guru: I'm maintaining, just been thinking though man
About the situation for today's youth man, the seeds man
What's your opinion on that?
Elijah Shabazz: Mmm that's strange I was thinkin the same thing
Something I read in the holy Qur'an how it says
""Has thou seen him who belies religion?
That is one who is rough, to the orphan.""
And no matter what we say our religion is
Whether it's Islam, Christianity, Juddaism, Buddha-ism, Old School-ism or New School-ism
If we're not schooling the youth WITH wisdom
Then the sins of the father will visit the children
And that's not keepin it real...
That's keeping it - *WRONG*

[Hook:]
Now that we're getting somewhere, you know we got to give back
For the youth is the future no doubt that's right and exact
Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers with power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leery
It's our inheritance; this is my Robin Hood Theory... Robin Hood Theory
[Verse 1:]
I seek Sun, deceive none, for each one must teach one
At least one must flow and show the structure, of freedom
It's me Dunn, cause petty things we don't need 'em
Let's focus to create somethin great, for all that sees them
They innocent, they know not what they face
While politicians save face genius minds lay to waste
If I wasn't kickin rhymes I'd be kickin down doors
Creatin social change and defendin the poor
The God's always been militant, and ready for war
We're gonna snatch up the ringleaders send em home in they drawers
But first where's the safe at? Let's make em show us
And tell em hurry up, give up the loot that they owe us
We bringin it back, around the way to our peeps
Cause times are way too deep, we know the Code of the Streets
Meet your defeat; this is my Robin Hood Theory... my Robin Hood Theory

[Verse 2:]
I floss my rhymes like dentals, my mental's presidential
From the wild ghetto districts to the plush residential
Essential, would be the message that I send you
I meant to, elevate at every venue
Pops told me to pursue what is true, and nothing other
And nowadays I pave the way for troops of my young brothers
Necessary by all means, sort of like Malcolm
Before it's too late; I create, the best outcome
So I take this opportunity, yes to ruin the
Devilish forces fucking up my black community
And we ain't doing no more interviews
Til we get paid out the frame, like motherfucking Donahue
We're taking over radio, and wack media
Cause systematically they getting greedier and greedier
Conquering turfs with my ill organization
Takin out the man while we scan the information
You wanna rhyme you best await son
You can't even come near, if you ain't got our share
You front on us this year, consider yourself blown out of here
Yeah... by my Robin Hood Theory

Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers with power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leery
It's our inheritance; this is my Robin Hood Theory

[Verse 3:]
God is Universal, he is the Ruler Universal
For those who can't follow that spells GURU when in my circle
I see all sides of my culture...
Design my thoughts like a sculpture
And chumps they wanna get with me cause I'm another entity
I'm sent to be, leadin the army of the century
Mention me, and snakes will retreat, eventually...
... due to my Robin Hood Theory

Now that we're getting somewhere, you know we got to give back
For the youth is the future no doubt that's right and exact

Sucka MCs,rap,Slaughterhouse,2012,"[Intro: Dj Drama]
Sometimes you gotta wonder
Maybe it's the competitive nature of the game
The story kills them

[Verse 1: Freeway]
This is the way the story goes, when you in it for the dough
And you swinging for the fence, close friends'll turn to foes
Act just like hoes, want you to get the dinner for 'em
Niggas trying to slow; walk me but I been up on 'em
Partly cause part of me got love for 'em
But a part of me got a slug for 'em
It's hard for me, he was there from the start of me
Shared gear. See, part of me still cares
But part of me feels, he 'bout to come to my house to slaughter me
Wait 'til I hit the balcony, then Dr. Martin me
This heart full of larceny, they think I'm the dollar tree
Since I'm the nigga with the weight and they ain't
They're like P90X trying to make me lose calories
State Prop chain-gang maintain salary
Freezer sends his goons through hourly, devouring
It's just the Philly in me
Word to Joey crack, jealous ones envy, sucka MC's
Fuck haters, get cheese
[Hook x2]
I can see my friends
Turn green with envy
(Jealous ones envy, sucka MC's
Fuck haters, get cheese)

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9""]
I said, with friends like these, who needs enemies
Inside this evil industry, where the green breeds greed, envy, and schemes
And schemes Of B & E's and dreams of seeing me up under guillotines
But the desert eagle I'm bringing with me can be its wings
It's supposed to be about respect
Your boys will watch you spend some of your dough and then they'll count the rest and bounce before you can bounce a check
He not jealous, he just wants you to split whatever you get with him
And all that he sees is all that you bought and it sticks with him
The snake in the grass from the garden of Eden, it bit him
The first recorded sin, for 4 to 10 to 25 to life
I can quote stories of lead from the top of my head like I don't write
Drunk and high on life, I learned to back up my own hype
When I had to steal back my own bike, pastor's on me like ""pass the collection plates"" of white on rice
God fearing, my only flaw's my giving heart
It's not conducive to being frugal and living smart
Maybe I'll die dumb
Leaving behind a beautiful corpse known for my hand on my balls like Cy Young
Eyes numb from constantly staying open
And constantly being haunted by promises they broken
We supposed to get money
[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
The bottom of a vodka bottle describes my drink behavior
You're far from biblical scriptures if you're thinking a drink can save ya
What happens when your semen donor leaves the streets to raise ya?
You raise your heat, ready to go HAM like Lincoln Abra
Ay bruh, I know this stripper
Who was talking to this nigga, who was talking while he tipped her
Bout the pitches and zippers he be flipping to get them chippers
He told her about his stash, slip of the the tongue off the liquor
Yeah I used to dick her, now I call her my play sister
Yeah, we can trust her, we can bust in on that buster while he's with her
With a ski mask, gloves and snubs doin it like a crook should
Slapped a bitch up a couple of times to make it look good
He said, ""Damn, Crooked, you're frozen cold""
When I'm broke, these are the types of thoughts that overload my dome
When I'm alone I done dirt that I never ever even told a soul
But my soul knows Ortiz, I need to slow my role

Got swinging but going nowhere; mud putters
Walking 'round all sour you little bud puffers

Flooded, flooded

And got the Richard Mille, flooded (Ice)
Cubans and bracelets and necklace (Ice), flooded
Stones in my teeth like they braces, flooded (Flooded)

[Verse 1]
Gold diamond chains, I'm the new Mr. T
All this ice on me, I could go and ski
Shorty on fleek with this Patek Philippe (Fleek)
Whole lot to see, clarity Vs
Cold like a polar bear, North Pole
Money stretch all the way from North Dakota (Dakota)
Know pretty bitches like Coca-Cola
Diamonds hit like they inmates in Angola (Hmm)
Look like a fight (Fight)
Block out your sight (Ice)
Whole lot of ice on (On)
These diamonds bite, we shining bright
Look like a light show (Show)
Hell of a price, expensive nights
She got a nice throat (Throat)
She got me right, I bought her ice

I spent two-fifty on just one chain
None of this shit came from Johnny Dang
Eliantte got me goin' insane
Diamonds updated, they 'head of the game
I'm underrated, they AP from Vegas
They hated, I waited, I knew shit would change
Pull up, Mercedes, my neck lookin' crazy
They hated, I waited, I knew shit would change
My life is wavy, I'm highly sedated
They thought I was crazy, I bought some more chains
Flood out the shady, I iced out the baby
And they goin' crazy protecting the name
Reach for these stones and get popped in your brain
No one's smoking stronger, they ain't stoppin' the train
Today is rose gold, I'm not rockin' the plain
I don't got it on, then I don't feel the same

Yeah, I feel like Jesse, cause I'm so excited
Yeah, she likes my jokes, so I'm not embarassed
Why are you datin' if you don't want marriage? (Chillout, relax)

Last Good Sleep,rap,Company Flow,1997,"[Intro]
At night I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
But one day you'll pay

[Verse 1: El-P]
Doomed to this kid that you fueled with anger actions
Disgust mostly sick most, never have satisfaction
Till your bones melt high incident clips and crumple zones
Hold a fix on you eternal, intruder up in my zone
Dwell the matter I must follow, why you proposed only the lonely know
Swallowed my mother when she was hollow
Who can blame a woman like her, singular parent
One love already dissolved and the solution left polluted
Two kids with a father who broke out as resoluted
So fuck it she needed love and you provided false clout
Stomping on the bottom man and I wish she just walked out
Knew you were Jekyll the stepfather, bit my tongue on the issue
Next to stormy weather and forced tolerance but secretly vexed
Wish I would have spoke on it but why deny the bliss
Mom's with a new husband casting needles puncture pressure
Briefly lifted the guilt from a divorce snuffing her pleasure
Now you're all up in the family tree, come broken nuclear
With termites corroded in your veins and elected to drown the pain
But the pain couldn't quite die with a thrown back whiskey sour
Puritan, crushing Moms between rocks for at least an hour
[Pre-Hook]
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

[Hook]
That's why
At night I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
Now every night of my life he beats his wife
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

[Verse 2: El-P]
Timepiece must've read early morning at least
So I lay death's cousin, woken by the sonics of the beast
That somewhere deep beneath me a fracture had seized at my neck
Breath was it, a flag that marked the end of my peace
Conference of the birds I heard my mother dove cry
Not absurd just routined I'd learned
Just keep my fucking grill locked and hope the entropy stops mid process
Stepfather's got to fight verbally when his liver's soaked
And products come in bottles stuck with drunken last nerve up too close
But I couldn't sense the distinction from the other nights' livest wires
Ceremony's sparked again a dry one in comparison to this one
Handing crutches to my psyche, I was tripping
Huddled up clutching sis I think I heard a dress ripping
I should've reacted to that
But I didn't know the extent, please
You could've caught him in time
Yeah, that thought's occurred to me constantly
Goblin digging my head and I don't know what he wants from me
Until one of us is dead I suppose
[Hook]
That's why
At night I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
Now every night of my life he beats his wife
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

[Verse 3: El-P]
Much more than abrupt I heard the silence erupt
But it was just a touch of tough love that I heard from above
The calm and the climate confused me
The dawn was a floozy
Barely risen but still beckoning to me
The song of the night's events amused me, morbidly
In a petrified state I wait, to Deadwood on duty
Just tempers flared I figured woozily
When all is dead and done a pair is just as fucking happy as they choose to be
Now off to where the wild things dwell for shuteye
The prospect bored me, awokened by the step sounds coming towards me
A quick glance at my mom's darkened silhouette in the hallway assured me
So I sunk with the hope that hibernation would cure me
And slept my last sleep while I counted clone sheep
And dreamt about nothing for the last time ever
The ignorance was blissful just a recollection
Of the gift of innocent times from a merciful deception
Woke to hazy landscapes to find my world defied the laws my mind mandates
Patching jugulars with Band-aids
The turn on you laid well above my bed
Were here and only barely through the shock of what her broken face told me
You should have known what happened
I was young and oblivious
He almost killed your mom
If I knew I could have done something
You'll never see him again
Yeah but I see him every night
And cover my ears in tears as he beats his fucking wife
[Hook]
At night I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
Now every night of my life he beats his wife
Until the day I die

[Verse 1]
I never was the one in the classroom sitting with my hand up
When the teacher told us that we needed to report
Anything that was happening at home
Like if I saw pipes or things of that sort
Cocaine dime bags laying on my front porch
Never made me feel sick 'til I found out what it was
No telling how many adults went in through my home
Had a convo with me, unavailable
And maybe I've caught the vibe and maybe they're right
And maybe I'll follow them footsteps of my folks
But that's only a theory 'cause of the people near me
Love me enough to never let me do that dope
But the crew I roll with knew that road
We took a left turn and pursued that dough
I remember being scared of the goons in the room
Passing needles around, spooning, smoke
At the time my young mind was curious
Gullible and naive still
I run around the apartments, hidden in darkness
And sparked it with Chris, Robby, and Will
And I didn't like the feeling at first
The taste in my mouth or the smell on my clothes
But I kept showing up after school to be cool
I would do anything with the bros
And I told my mama lies over and over
What I was doing and where did I go?
Didn't hurt my feelings anymore
I didn't care about being an asshole
Unless my girlfriend found out
That my backpack had a fat packed out roll
But out the blue, she pulled a joint out her purse
That she stole from her folks, and that's all that she wrote
I quote
[Chorus]
I got a question for you, please don't tell nobody
""Boy, do you get high?"" I said, ""All the time""
We got a secret, baby, I won't tell nobody
""When do you get high?"" She said, ""All the time""
Give me a lesson, baby, teach me something new
I said, ""I'll be your guy,"" She said, ""Give me a try""
We got a secret, baby, we won't tell nobody
You and me get high, all the time

[Verse 2]
You and me? Best friends 'til the end, amen
Ride around in the box, ""Guilty Conscience,"" Eminem
Growing up too fast, no bars over no hoes
No high is too high, no bottle is too low
Pack it up, let it burn, pass it, my turn
Let me hit one more time
Let me live, let me learn
Who am I for you to judge?
Who are you? It's just drugs
It's only weed, it's only pills
It's my dope, it's my buzz
One time, one try, then I say bye
I'm lying, I can't stop now, and why?
I tried this, I tried that, I came clean, my act
Took five yellow pills, passed out, came back
D.U.I. sometimes, too lit, can't drive
I made it home, I survived, I shouldn't be alive
My bad, my fault, I'm just an alco'
Shoot 'em up, bang-bang, no chase, no salt
[Chorus]
I got a question for you, please don't tell nobody
""Boy, do you get high?"" I said, ""All the time""
We got a secret, baby, I won't tell nobody
""When do you get high?"" She said, ""All the time""

Nothing more stressful than burying your best bull (For real)
Feeling empty make you keep that Smith and Wes' full (For real)
I realized that it's more snakes and less wolves
So me and my Tre-pound like KD and Westbrook (Woo!)
We just trying to get up out that cesspool
We just trying to eat, not up in no mess hall (yeah)
My old head that used to rob, dropped the best jewels
He said, ""Your failure's gonna teach you to be successful""
I'm rocking karats but I never ate my vegetables (Never)
I'm playing festivals, I used to play the vestibules
Stunting every day, my schedule was flexible (Flex, flex)
VIP sectionals, grabbing on my testicles (Flex!)
Got an extra full clip for that extra bull shit
Nigga you gotta give us some answers
You're doing questionable shit
Your old lady showed me good times on some Esther Rolle shit
We live in a cold world, I'm on my eskimo shit

Malik died in the summer
It get live in the summer
Head to Brooklyn, I'm knocking this Bobby Shmurda in my G-Stars
Free my GS9 niggas, throw Rowdy on and breeze off
Since a rookie shooting like Ray Allen in that 3-4
When he was a Milwaukee Buck
Not whispering, I'm talking up, look
I can't be worried about ISIS, my life is trifling
Affording dollar slices, just praying they don't indict us
Keeping both my fists raised up, I'm like the fighting Irish
Had molly sales at Notre Dame, when ain't nobody know my name
Remember giving 'caine out
Remember all the misses giving brain out
Remember when Fab was spelling his name out
Before I bought the foreigns, took the train route
When Cam had that pink Range out
It was Reggie, wasn't no paint out
Vegas nights, Sky Dweller Rollie look like a Vegas light
Was tryna pitch an eighth of white
Just to go eat some steak and rice
I know you hate this life, jeweler acting nervous tryna break the ice
{""Nothing scares me anymore""}
I love red bottoms but really hate the spikes
It's sad

Got that summertime, summertime sadness

Ayy check this out
Ayy, this shit gon' keep gettin’ bigger and bigger
And these niggas gon' keep gettin' mad
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

[Verse]
These niggas hating, they gossip and envy me
But in they pockets they don’t have a penny
Run up on me, you get put out your misery
I really honor the second amendment
Come get your hoe 'cause she just blew a kiss at me
And she keep beggin' to come home with me
She keep on talkin' 'bout what she gon' do to me
I told her prove it bitch, come on with it
All out in Vegas, I'm rockin the latest
Wrist hangin' out the window of a Mercedes
Rockin’ gold like a dope boy in the 80s
Bedazzle my bracelet, don’t do nothing basic
I'm the new wave and these niggas outdated
Keep me some cake every day, my belated
All at my shows snappin’ up with the ladies
And they keep on talkin' 'bout havin' my babies
(Hold on, you doin’ too much mane, you trippin'... what you doin'?)
Skinny pimp I'm lookin' for the chewin', yup
Me and broke niggas not congruent, nope
Fresh to death like I'm dressed for a viewing
Diamonds ice skating like I played for the Bruins (like the hockey team)
Look at all this money I'm accruing
Ballin' in New York, Pat Ewing
Flyer than a butterfly
I'm committed, I ain't fuckin with them other guys
Love my niggas like my brothers on my mother's side
Fuck a nigga if he fuckin' with the other side
Give a fuck 'bout your feelings I don't sympathize
Ridin' 'round with a snow bunny, not the Energizer
Cute face, slim waist, with some bigger thighs
Broke hoes, I don't ever put my dick inside, nah
I'm a big dog, big rings on my paws
Top grade stones and they come with no flaws
Balenciaga tennis and Balenciaga draws
Hoes on my dick like my last name Claus
Been a lil minute since I been to the ball
This shit that I'm rockin' you can't find it at all
Wanna go against me, better make the right call
Never [?] bitch I keep my eyes on the ball

Ooh, I see the plot before they make a move
Air your block out if I get in that mood
You not a real one, you got the streets fooled
You not my nigga, we just went to school
Nigga we wit it if you wanna feud
You want the smoke, we got premium fuel
Pretty lil bitty, keep sendin' me nudes
She love the way my pockets be true
Prey on these niggas and pray to the bible
Nobody taught me the art of survival
Ain't got no love for an opp or a rival
My niggas shot on me, should never have tried 'em
Killing these niggas and bitches with silents
You pillow talkin' to women in private
Jit wanna talk but I want your vagina
She keep my dick covered in her saliva
My bitch stay mad at me, she say I'm arrogant
Ain't gotta say I'm the shit it's apparent
Draped in designer but these look like hand-me-downs
They like boy what in the fuck is you wearin'
Before the deal I bought me a charger
2019 I might get a McLaren
Back in the day I was rockin' in starter
Now I'm in Gucci while runnin' my errands
You talk about shit you ain't did
You should be workin' at Lids
He threw a rock and he hit
That's the type of shit that I forbid
I've been traveling all over the grid
I might get me a flight to Madrid
Free my niggas doin' the bid
Forgive all the shit that they did
Pop at my shit and I know they gon' quote it
So put-together they think that I wrote it
Tryna decide on a Patek or Rollie
Covered in water, might need me a floatie
Bitin' my swag but they thought I wouldn't notice
They wanna kick it but I'm not a goalie
Most of these niggas be rogus and bogus
Tinted my windows like I was the police
Make sure it's facts when you get to speaking
Thumbin' through racks, this shit so intriguing
Fuck niggas hate, they see me succeeding
Fire up my blunt 'fore I walk in the meeting
Hustin' back, these niggas receding
Pockets get fat, what the hell they been eating?
Won't cut 'em slack, but these niggas need it

Everybody enjoys a good horseride

Right out the saloon door on your butt
Come back in and buy a round of whiskey
Guess what? All is forgiven! (DJ LEARY)
Flippin' the jib with Calamity Jane
And you're another guy that's probably an injun
This whiskey is warm and it tastes like piss
OH NO~! Mustache smells like piss!

You sit and think about how you can hit the scene
Take one look inside your mirror, clear to see
You need to find yourself as honest as can be
There must be fifty ways to make a record
Now don't get wrapped into the hype and what they think
This shit ain't rocket science and the scene changes with beats
And now you ask yourself, how you want to be seen?
There must be fifty ways to make a record

Stands around and looks intrigued by what he saw, now he asks me
How he can make hit songs to reach the top

Fifty ways to make a record

And would you please explain about the fifty ways?

Cash tight, write it up, flashlight, last night
Was a ball, lost a eye off the fly y'all
Bloody tab, he fell headfirst off the drywall
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
It's like the quickening, quit your sickening bickering
Thing is kickin' in, the wick is flickerin'
The super muh'frickin' villain, wit'cha through thick and thin

Reflect it like SolarBright

No doors, whores testing the course

And the bouncers are haters
They act tight, and these drunk ass niggas always tryna fistfight
Ain't no wrong, tell 'em (that's right)

Let's be real, think I'd risk it all for fifteen bills?

[Verse]
Circo bus to the ville, same day I'm security shipped
They don't want me on the wing with Twin, they flagged that down as security risk
Six week trial, witness lying in court, now the jury thinks I'm sick
They said bad character, played my vids in court and said I'm the Prince of the 6
Let's be real, think I'd risk it all for fifteen bills?
Fifteen bills I spend on petty, fifteen bills can't buy my grills
Sip my tea, still I'm calm, kidnap, torture, firearms
Silent room when the evidence came, legal paper stuck to my palm
Solicitor said it's hard to say, he don't really think I'll buss this case
We caught him out on several lies, I see the look on the jury's face
They set a man up to fail, true greatness will always prevail
I did not once apply for bail cah I knew deep down I was heading to jail
Life when it hits you fast, lost in thought while I chill on a twos
Reading statements up in my cell, pissed cah I know that none of it's true
They probably don't care if I get lifed off, truth is I got a lot to lose
They think I'm mad and a psychopath but they couldn't even live one day in my shoes
Prosecution wants me gone, they don't even care if I'm right or wrong
Witness scared to snitch in court so he video linked just singing songs
I plead guilty, it's long, pain in my heart even though I'm strong
Prosecution still offered no deal and that's when I knew that now it's on
My name holds weight in every jail, man know I'm patterned
I'm waiting on the call from the jury, I got the call, let's see what happen
I buss three firearms, I laughed, the prosecution looked shattered
But the judge still gave man twelve and a half in the can and that's what mattered
***** got bagged with skengs, that's five waps to be precise
Niggas in jail don't wanna get robbed so they give me their food, just tryna be nice
I paid a cost to be the boss, yo, it's nuttin', just name your price
***** hit up free flow, now I'm hearing a opp got sliced
His jewels got robbed like months ago and he didn't say shit
Now I'm in jail and his bredrin's gassed him so he's out 'ere writing scripts
I do what I want and that's why man's jewels got robbed
And if I want, I'll get man blazed on Gods
Young Dizz, I'm the Prince of the 6, I gotta make sure that no one forgot
It ain't nuttin' to get man dropped, Smith & Wesson still get cocked
Phone up *****, he'll go 'round there and tape that off
***** just done that booting, now he's in jail just baking off
These feds were moving hungry, I can't believe they bugged my whip
Me and ***** was talking loose, we was talkin' 'bout beef and brand new sticks
I went to trial and buss that case, I live this life, I don't pretend
That yute ain't shed no blood, no way he can call himself my friend
Little man ran off with the pack, what was he thinking? He must've been frassed
It didn't take long for a drop, three hours later, the yute got napped

Running the streets and playing pretend
Ain't none of us ever thought that it would end, no
Never dealt with any stress

Couple of kids who were starting some shit
But now that never did manifest

Some went to work and then some went to college
And some just became alcoholics
Spent every night in the club and
Drinking and smoking it up and
Lookin' for women for lovin'
Had us going 'til they closed it up then
Stayed up 'til the sun rose

Waking up in a bed that was unknown
I rolled over and try to find some clothes
And she says

Had a baby, built her a nursery
Found love and married in nary's
And yearly we celebrate our anniversary, yeah
Me and my boys I don't see as much
But still catch up now and then
Throwing host parties instead of clubs
And it's just us, couple o' our friends
And I'm good with that, yeah, I'm cool with that
Trying to look ahead instead of looking back
And I never thought that it wouldn't last
And we've grown apart like the wooded path
In the forest we played in when we were 10
And what I know now, wish I knew then
'Cause I miss them days, I miss them days
But after tomorrow I'll miss today

Chemical cutthroats, bound to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain, this ain't no game
I'll show no shame, I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted Cain, I'll twist again
I'll push the blade, as plain as day
Known to what these sayers say, known to what these doers do
It's you and who and you-know-where, we's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear, we happy on we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart, it's start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach, the soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth over, return of the ogre!

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be, come and save the night
'Cause I don't believe
When the morning comes, it doesn't
Seem to say an awful lot to me

Death the Kid, you know how it is
Hate to dismiss any mistake
If it ain't right, then you must be kiddin'
Joke's mislead because you now slippin'
Oblique mind then I get a fix
Simply blast it, it ain't a trick
Just one click, then a second click
Rest is oh my goodness, you're history!
It ain't a mystery to entry
Just that I'm not so intrigued
Don't get it wrong son, I'm a sweet treat
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Have a nice dream!

Making me shimmer because you lacking heat
Stop taking chances, it gets real step
Watch where you step cause my Glocks creep!

Not enough for me to satisfy
Any mistakes let's clarify
Let's post it for the classified
Find your bad and boom! Bye bye!
Do it together with my entourage
Please stick your head in the back of garage
Have a little sell and sell you cheap
So please get out, you're outta my league!

So intrigued!

You still don't understand the range
That you stay in, I ain't playin', no more tradin'
Losin' it ain't easy to get back

Hit your case with a big, bad, slap
Click the cap and go Blap! Blap! Blap
Everything I touch will go platinum
Somehow people figure that I'm in it

So that's how you feel, huh?
If it needs to go down like this, so be it

[Verse 1: Mom & Dad]
Let me tell you what you left me here to do right now
Clean this, like, it's not your house
I've been worked all day, I still ain't sat down
I can clean it up
Nope, it's too late now!
You done messed up
Your genes are why he's failin' the semester
And you got him lookin' dusty how he's dressed up
So cheap, he's strugglin' to save you two bucks
Speaking of, you put a ring on it, promised fifty-fifty
Now you've got it twisted, talking 360
I been really workin', you've been barely stressin'
Yet your hairline's lookin' like the Great Recession
If I say something, take my side or nothing
You don't take mine
Hey, don't change the subject
Work all day, but can't clean up banana
You're the real one that needs this bandana
That's how I feel too
Making messes? Make your meals too
You don't text back
Babe, I just got it
You've got time to talk? You've got time to respond then
I won't get mad, baby, just be honest
I was gonna text you
See, I knew you saw them
Take the couch, I want my bed back
You've got all this, but still do all that

That's how you feel, huh?
All the work I do just ain't enough?
And I'm never dirty, I stay cleanin' up
This was your room
Don't bring up old stuff
And I do notice things, I pay attention
Then, what's different about me?
That's a trick question
Graduated, but still love testin'
Naggin' on me 24/7
This the same thing, here we go again
This ain't your way, this is Dad's Plan
Every night another nickel goes to waste
'Cause you need name-brand, the other tastes the same
And my hairline's thick and healthy too
Like the mustache you've got coming through
How you saying rules and do the same thing?
I appreciate you, appreciate me
And no, don't call me cheap, those Weezy's look real
Plus, they were twenty-five bucks, that's a steal
Got you red bottoms, just look at the heel
Baby, I love you, but you need to chill
Maybe, I would if it weren't for this mess
I didn't make that
Well, who made it then?
I was at work all day
Well, I was too

Nigga, don't tell me what niggas say about me
Tell me why they feel comfortable telling you...

[Verse]
The saddest stories comes from those who once had the glory
Had the foreigns, diamond watches and the baddest shorties
Now they in their latter 40s, bunch of kids, scattered shorties
No respect from the neglect, they call they daddy Corey
I'm from a different cloth, that ain't the pattern for me
It's levels to this shit, it's different categories (yea)
Can't be like them niggas out here looking fat and gaudy
They ain't never won no rings but be mad at Horry
Talking 'bout, ”man that nigga don't deserve that shit”
Like ”I was really in these streets, I used to serve that shit”
We started from the bottom, had to topsy-turn that shit
Get it while the gettings good after that preserve that shit
My ex texted me last night, but I curve that shit
Coulda end up hitting it, be too late to swerve that shit (ERR!)
That's a young mistake, Lord knows I made me some (word)
I love getting brain, that never made me dumb
All that did was made me cum, swear these hoes made me numb (yea)
Only feelings caught is bitch you been shoulda gave me some
I knew niggas who had some bread never gave me crumbs (feel me)
Drink the whole fucking juice and never saved me some (feel me)
I know how young niggas feel, I had to live through shit
See the world as constipated, nobody gon give you shit
I learned that niggas gon be niggas, yeah we shouldn't do it
But hoes gon be hoes, they just ain't admitting to it
Where I been? Getting to it, going through and getting through it
Running round killing shit and telling cops I didn't do it (Niicee)
That's why they call me ”Young OG”
And I'ma spit this dope shit until my tongue OD
I flew my shorty in from Cali and she brung OG
She got me chilling in my city but my lungs OT
And fuck them niggas online, reply why?
Broke niggas talking cause it's free WiFi
[Outro: Excerpt from the movie ""Baby Boy""]
I hear you; you know the problem with you lil niggas?
You think you know everything about the damn world, and you don't know shit
Well I see you got yourself a lil business goin'
Well that's good, that's good when you make that paper
But when you makin' paper you gotta learn some rules to go with it
You gotta learn the difference between guns and butter
There are two types of niggas in this world: there are niggas with guns and niggas with butter
Now what are guns? The guns, that's the real estate
That's stocks and bonds, artwork, you know shit that appreciates with value
What's the butter? Cars, clothes, jewelry - all that other bullshit that don't mean shit after you buy it
That is what it's all about - guns and butter baby!

Letter to Pac,rap,Hussein Fatal,2012,"[Intro]
Yeah, I know it's long overdue, Hussein Fatal, Thugtertainment, you know what I'm saying?
It's a letter to my homeboy, it's my dog, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout, it's my dog
Since the air ways been clear for like ten years, I thought I write him a letter

[Verse 1]
Dear Pac, I shed a teardrop, missin' you and Yak for years
You changed my life man, I wish I was there
That night up in the MGM Grand, can't understand
They gang bangin', nobody had a gun in they hand
Shot you down in the streets, like President Kennedy
And we still pourin' Hennessy out for your memory
Setcha calmed down, Malik gettin' grown now
Resemble E.D.I a little bit, but he got his own style
Roddy shot Yak, Mu took the Shahada
I had another baby girl, and I named her Assata
Her middle name your last name, her family tree
I can't help but think where we would be
Out on Crenshaw, Slauson, flossin' how we used to
Ridin' down sunset, bangin' the Juice Crew
Everybody takin' your songs and remixin' 'em
Mixtapin' them joints so we don't get chips from 'em
Haters still hatin', I can't get no air play
There’s rumors that you still here, but that’s just hearsay
Snoop ain't reachin' out to us, neither is Suge
He catchin' slack over your murder, so he ain't doin' good
Noble and E.D.I still on the grind
And Keisha doin' her thang, and Nutt-So keep it real all the time
Niggas miss you with them Sunkist sodas and all your jokes
The older brother I never had, nigga the dope
The greatest of all times, actin', rhymes
Politically speaking, no silly ass punchlines
Treach took it hard when they murked you
Brought us closer together though
'Cause now he a part of my circle, nigga we miss you
[Interlude]
Straight up, I know I can speak for all the homies on this side We all miss you
And it's more than just a song, my nigga, 'cause that ain't 'bout nothin'
We did 400 of those in one year, ya heard me?

[Verse 2]
Ain't nobody lookin' out, I know they all hated you
I wonder how shit woulda been if you'da made it through
I can't believe they got you, you know how me and Yak do
I'da rolled out on them niggas before they popped you
And everybody feel us, but ain't feelin' the pain
I'm up against all odds, but I'm still in the game
What's wrong with these poo putts, how it's all over?
And I'll come out squeezin', if I can start it all over
The mainstream ain't feelin' the laws, and seem weird now
We don't get the spins like before, 'cause you ain't here now
Only God can judge me, would tell that to these niggas
Learned one thing from Death Row, and that's how to read niggas
But now I'm back home on the East Coast
They know I'm 'bout that thug life, so I keep my heat close
At least most wanted, niggas like us don't live too long
That's why I had to put this pain in this song
And if nothin' else, tell Storm, Yak, Gade, and Big
I'll see 'em soon but for now, later my nigg
Pac, I miss you nigga
[Outro]
And we still mobbin' out here for all y'all
One love to all y'all niggas though",9819,52896
DONT LOOK BACK,rap,Luke Christopher,2018,"[Verse 1]
I've been thinking ’bout you, babe
Every damn night, every day
Way I feel will never change
It's a crazy thing to say

I've been in my head all day
Wondering if you, you might feel the same
What if we just ran away?
Don’t look back, don't look away

I'm still thinking ’bout you, babe
Every damn night, every day
Never wanna take a break
Through the hard times, I will stay
And I know it's not a secret
Hard to wake up without a reason
Never will I ever hesitate, no
I just wanna show you what I'm made of
Somebody to hold down when it's cold out
Put your hair back, let your toes out
Wanna give you something that’s new
I know it's always the proof
[Bridge]
Oh, take my word, one day there'll be wedding bells
I don't know what you heard, baby girl, I'm scared as hell
You could be like Bonnie and I could be like Clyde
Us against the world 'til the day we die

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been in my head all day
Wondering if you, you might feel the same
What if we just ran away?
Don't look back, don't look away

Heed the Word of the Brother,rap,X Clan,1990,"[Intro: Professor X]
Exist in a state of vainglorious
As we are protected by the red, the black, and the green
Heed the words of the brother
Sissy!

[Verse 1: Brother J]
Letters to words word to phrase into paragraph
Heed math as 'J begins class
Science of past is now brought to the rhyme fix
From the scrolls, straight to the verb stick
Gods to gods from gods to man
Many kings, many leaders, a fist from a hand
They call me militant, now what does this mean?
Do I carry a gun to let the army see?
With the cause I'll never pause as simply as the brother
Raise the flag, raise the colors
Red, black, green, with the key the difference
Words make a way in the world in an instant
Living to die and I die to live again
360 degrees...comprehend
A man getting stronger 'til he's man no longer
Unearthly state makes the time seem shorter
Forever radiant, awareness brought forth the One
Open eyes, strong sun
Practice and preach, stand about what I teach
So you all stand starvin' as I start to unleash
Words of the brother
[Hook: P-Funk Sample]

[Verse 2: Brother J]
Great blackness brought from the genesis
Won't exist 'til armageddon is a witness
The originals built the Earth
Why must there be aggression to learn a basic lesson?
Quite majestic, stern within reality
A juggernaut when you tamper with mentality
I wear a crown, extension and dimension of a brain cell
Bringin' hell to the sellouts
Forever tangled web we weave
Always tryin' to obtain, no attempt to achieve
Descendents of kings and queens act like jesters
Never potential, caught up [in the measure?]
Jealousy of what are we
Becomes tendency for their thievery
Alright, cool, but no need to pull a trigger
Cause that's a fool, I get my [?] like [?] stool
To produce the words that they drool about
It's another way of checkin' out these sissies
Who may try to extinct my principality
But of course they're not havin' me?
Madness from beginning, I'm the end, observe me:
Ignorance is not a trend
So as I beckon for few seconds
Pull the reins, and heed the words of the brother
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brother J]
One with the universe mastering words on the verse
Funk is a force I exert
Egyptian, African, now I'm on the Blackwatch
Check my sundial, synchronize the clock
I can catch a shadow as the Moon reflects the Sun
Creator's eyes make a path to brother one
So now I walk softly and carry a big stick
A verb stick, so you natives seem to lick
J brings the funk and spreads jam to the wheat bread
In the funk of this, one vainglorious
Unearthly resistance, strong with persistance
Grand Verbalizer kicks this
Tribal connection, pyramids witness the funk bearer
Vibe sharer not the error
Brother is balanced like the scales of Thoth
I knew the mind of man makes stone seem soft
Corrupts all systems, positive poison of me
Some call it Ankh, it's a key
Black is a color, while blackness state of a mindstate
But how many of you think?
Today the Brother J can find the better way
So be it, plan it down and make it stay
I serve a purpose, yet I am not the G.I. Joe
I am the Brother, yo I can never swear a foe
So just hasten your step to the mic and stage area
As I drop the science that breaks the clock barrier
Words of old make me more than a beginner
The key opens knoweldge and plays as an antenna
Americana man, Africana brother
Don't forget the land cause the birth is from the Mother
A vibe is in place, obtained and discovered
Tune in your audio and heed the word of brother

Two things my mama warned me never to do was steal or get dropped, yup

Maybe Kid Rock, either way it go, they sure they gettin’ guap, why?
Because they dropped up out of school and rock some jewels that cover what tuition costs, oou
Yup, I know that it's sad but everybody tryin' to fill a void
Hell even me, I tried to blow the doughdy with my wodie, all I got was paranoid
That was back when I was kinda chubby, hung with wildcats, no Kentucky
I’ve crashed too many beats in a row for you to think I'm gettin' lucky
Can't you see the flow is God given, boppers see that he got God in him
So they frequently slide in my DMs and offer raw kitten
I don't trip, it ain't temptin', we both been prayin' from a distance
Well I pray for ’em, they prey on me, we just pray a lil’ different, oou

Where I'm from they would pull up with tools and hop out on a car like you called triple A, oou

Now how does one explain the sudden feeling he feels
When he's not sure what he's feelin' but he knows that its real
To take something intangible and try to explain
Not fully understandin' all the thoughts in my brain
Relationships had always made me sick - done wit 'em
Then she came up and hit me like some bricks- a ton of 'em
So now my mind struggles just to try and comprehend
And make sure what I'm feelin' is for real and not pretend
I wanted not to deal wit' it and chill wit all my friends
'Cause everyone's in L (love) wit one and sells it like a trend
I've tried to force a feeling that just seemed so far away
And after all was said and done I found it hard to stay
So that now I've moved past all the drama I dealt with
Imagine my surprise when I met this chic and felt shit
So much of my life I spent hidin' and fightin' it
Looked into her eyes and I kinda started likin' it

Now how does one forget about the ex and how shit went
And movin' past the fact that I got fears of commitment
The fact is I don't know, tryin' to make sense of it
You hit me wit a text and then I start getting all sensitive
Like damn I'm a bitch, but dude this girl is beautiful
Just take me by the hand and you can push back all my cuticles
I know I got some baggage and you feel as if I'm panickin'
But everytime I see you all my fears just get to vanishin'
So Intoxicated by the way that you just taste
Forget about the haters baby move into my place
Certain things about that could not just be replaced
Like when your nose is itchy how you scrunch up your whole face
And everything before that I ever thought was corny
Started makin' sense to me I wish you would've warned me
I'm takin' by sensations that I just wasn't prepared for

Yeah, I'm 1 up, on the block from sun down to sun up
Mobbin through the city, I would never put my gun up
Chalupa on tuck mode, yelling out fuck hoes
Got a bitch naked in the club like ""fuck clothes""
These niggas fucked around and woke the beast up
Back to the pony tails, khaki's and creased up
HGC til the whole word freeze up
Hand out the window while I'm throwin my C's up
Yeah, blaze my motherfuckin weed up
Fuck the police til them hoes lift these up

Piss me off at the wrong time, I'll demonstrate

I wake up, bake up, gotta get my cake up
Pussy feel good, look great without no make-up
Real nigga here, not a faker
I hate y'all, a boss nigga certified player
Niggas want beef, give it to em like a waiter
Shorty want the wood, so you know I had to stake her
Treat her like her maker, get a room treat it like Jamaica
Just one time, treat it like a favour
The VIP's on me, you down to smoke, I got a couple zips on me
Got diamonds on but I be doin shit low-key
Don't gotta make a call, my niggas with the shits
Cause real niggas don't slip, bitch
[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yo, I'm 1 up, out here, still tryna come up
First you feel a burnin sensation, then you numb up
Act like you tryna hang and get hung up
Soon as you bang-bang, charges get brung up
Bring a nigga right to the register, get him rung up
Use to go see my connect and pick a ton up
Quickest way to get some respect, pick a gun up
And just start shooting whoever you in front of
Top 5 dead or alive, I'm just one of
One shot deal, one life, you get one love
All that old fly shit will get a nigga done up

Doing drugs ain't nobody but me know what the fuck I'm on
A lot of shit I said I wouldn't ever try
But when in Rome you just do as the Romans do

A lot of shit I wish I'd told you
A lot of shit I wish I didn't do
When it was you it was only you
Like the type of shit like I would kill for you

When it was you it was only you
Like the type of shit like I would kill for you

I Missed the Bus,rap,Kris Kross,1992,"I missed the bus [ohh]
I missed the bus
I missed the bus [ohh]
I missed the bus

[Verse 1/Daddy Mac]
I went to bed late but I didn't think late would AFFECT ME
Early came around then late wouldn't LET ME
Wake up - WAKE UP - so I can get dressed
I guess my body was mad cause I gave it no rest
And when I finally did awake it was a quarter to eight
Jumped in the shower and I knew I was late
Stepped out, put on my jeans and my Ewings
And said to myself if I miss school I'm ruined
But I ran down hill in a RUSH RUSH
I ran down the hill TRYIN TO CATCH THE BUS
Now I'm hopin to myself everything is cool
Standin' on my block like a fool
For (1) I'm all alone and (2) the bus is gone
(3) if I miss school, this weekend I'll be at home
Can somebody come real fast to my rescue
I'm stuck at the crib and I don't know what to do
[Hook: repeat 2x]
I missed the bus [ohh]
I missed the bus
I missed the bus [ohh]
And that is somethin I will never ever ever do again

[Verse 2/Mac Daddy]
I was up - HE WAS UP - but I laid back down
Thinkin' I could chill 'til the time came around
And I did - HE DID - but a little too long
Cause when I woke up, yo the bus was gone
I almost broke my neck tryin' to get out the door
And I chased the bus 'til my feet was sore
On the trail - THE TAIL - but I couldn't catch up
I guess it must have been my day for me to have bad luck
Cause I lost my lunch MONEY, book bag BUSTED
Scuffed up my sneakers, now I'm really disgusted
And when I got to school it was the same old thing
Stepped in the class and the school bell rang
It was nothin' I could do, I tried to explain
But the teacher treated me like I was playin' a game
YOU LOSE YOU LOSE - the day was a no win
I learned to never miss my bus again

I feel alive, like no one can take me down
I've been afire, Lord knows I've been feeling down
I could've died, Lord knows that He kept me alive
I have purpose and He's working while I'm searching for mine

Trying to make it home, I couldn't even first-base it
But I keep it going 'causе I know that Heaven's waiting

Lifestyles of the Broke and Almost Famous

[Verse 1]
""Herbert Anthony you need to get you life together""
That's my momma bothered by, how I'm living life like whatever
They say im pressed for time, but I don't press the issue
I just stay on my grind,chain smoking marijuan help me free my mind
What a coincidence, like feeling guilt stricken by your innocence
In a sense im livin in my second childhood
Dont pay a lick of rent, where I eat, sleep, and shit
And when you twenty-two that don't sound good
Maybe if I went to school it'll be cool
I've have something to fall back on if this rap don't crack
Perhaps i'd have a better story had I sold crack
Lets go back, to Carson high fluctuating my goals
Writing rhymes through the lecture knew I should've took notes, yo
Sometimes I think im running in place, chasing hopes
So is my name as Ab-Soul or is it average joe
[Hook] (x2)
All this commotion goes in one ear, out the other
I'm still gone make it, one way or the other

(quit acting like a kid herb, gone be a man
It's a man's world, how you suppose to feed your fam
You need to act more like an adult, pull up your pants
I know you do music but what's your plan B man)

[Verse 2]
If I knew when I was younger would I grew to know
I coulda tackle things more different, coulda been more defensive
Coulda been more responsible, coulda been more persistent
But I didn't and I ain't repenting
My parents wake up in the morning to a cup of coffee
Then go off to work. It kills'em when im still in bed snoring
Only if they knew, their young boy was in the stu
'til like 5 AM cookin up classics to make them
Proud as house niggas that could stay in
That was rather brash, but you can replace these scraps with straight cash
I told jay I'mma buy her a house one day
I'll probably send Katie and Kira off to college too
But right now I'm broke as a joke, I should do comedy
Dude, I need a job, somebody hire me fast
So I could win my girl over, she probably cheatin on my ass
You motherfuckers better try and snatch her while she up for grabs
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(Ab-Soul talking)
Its like real difficult to articulate it
It's like you got your goals. You got your aspirations
Your dreams, and you chasing that, you pursuing that
But in-turn it cost for you to sacrifice alot of your availability to go out their and get this paper, nah mean?
Its hard to say you a man still and livin at your momma house..

Yo, I had a conversation with my step-pops
Basically inquiring the time frame when I'mma pop
I told'em I ain't know but I'm determined to blow
Not like a fluffer, more like plaques that's platinum and gold
Thats on my great-grandmother
He shook his head and said:
""I don't know much about the music industry but whats been said
The people ain't making no bread, lets be more realistic
How you gone take care of a wife? how you gone feed your children
Im on my knees everyday tryna provide for yall
I bought that car that you dippin, but you don't chip in
You shouldve went to UCLA, like your cousin Jay
He got a big signing bonus, every year like 80k""
I looked him in the face and said ""It ain't about the money
And honestly, buying an education sounds funny
But have a little faith in your son, I'll come through for ya,""
He said be a man Herb, thats all I really want from ya

Teeth marks on the skin
The greatest trick the devil ever played was to take away my friend
I got your face engraved into my flesh
So I can try to make amends with that day I won't forget
In Minnesota I flew in so that we could both record
Me and Kristoff Krane were supposed to go on tour
Nobody answered, we were knocking on your door
And when they carried out your body, I was staring at your shoes on the floor
Still the answers never come
Your funeral was beautiful, it captured what you loved
I sat there in a stupor, fractured by the hugs
That I gave your family members, growing sadder by the months
But I won't dwell inside the ends
And that's not what you would want, you would tell me find connections
To the world and to tell it my confessions
The hell that I invest in is a part of something bigger
Words that you would write, they would carve into the center
Right on target 'til they start to fill my heart up with the letters
Shadows have shadows and it's darker than remembered
When this story has an ending to the part I had together with my friend
[Verse 2]
Absence makes the heart grow fonder of the time before the absence
And the nights spent trying to imagine
When you played I was blinded by the magic you displayed
I tried to reenact it in a way
I need the dark today to see the stars decay
Cause if I can fall asleep, then I can dream we are awake
Another shot of Jameson and PBR to chase
Another conversation in a seedy bar to play, right?
Man, this side of me's the worst
When I'm terrified that all I'll leave's a dynasty of dirt
But you believed in me and I believed your words
So in turn, I believed in things when I would need the courage
To move on, on and on and on and on it goes
When I'm nodding off an awful lot to songs that you had wrote
I want to honor all the art and progress that you showed
I miss my confidant and honest talks allotted on the phone
With you Mike -- I wish that I could hug you again
It's getting harder to pretend and I can't undo what's been
Thanks for being someone I could come to, a friend
I hope I make you proud -- I love you, the end

[Snippet of Micheal ""Eyedea"" Larsen, spoken]
Isn’t a person just a collection of their mistakes, and also their, kind of, undoing of their mistakes? I mean, what else are you? You know, you’re always…you’re always just the reaction to the bad parts of yourself, I think. And I think that’s what is kind of like, a driving motivation behind any human being that’s…who wants to continue to grow and live life. ‘Cause they’re looking at their flaws and trying to, go beyond it. And I think that a person, you know, essentially dies when they think that they found themselves, ya know? Unless you want to admit that you, yourself, are not an individual, and are just part of a whole…movement of ideas, and thought, and culture, and humanity and, furthermore, the universe, and everything -- unless you really feel like that, and you’re walking through walls, you know, you are always trying to find yourself. And it’s usually a person who believes that they’ve found “the answer” -- found “the end” -- that there actually is a psychological end. And then what’s the point of, you know, doing anything after that?",28568,25372

I don’t know where my comp is, no trace of my PC
OG told me don’t dump clips, just and aim and squeeze and watch the rest happen
Same tactics when I started rapping, I was still trapping, capping, finding whoops
They been non flexing, selling half truths, molly calling, just molly popping
To make it worse we got money problems, securing profit by any means
Is my mindset, stacking dollars on green master, bloodline my benefactors
My generation all loose cannons, just knocked and there’s no answer
Words eat em like throat cancer, she eat cock like coke backwards
When I stroke slow she cum faster, that’s pussy paces
But she let my gang fuck, straight A’s for participation
Pill bottle my marijuana, douple cup my liquidation
OG Mac cause I earned that, young Phil but my skin black
Been trill but this a mixed track, and Mac will like Mike did

They told me to see the glass half full cause some see it as half empty
I chose to see the glass twice the size it needed to be
Smashed it against the wall in the kitchen
On the floor going through withdrawals I was itchin'
She rescued me, my heroine to the end
But then she morphed into heroin in a syringe
Around my bicep, I would tie a shoestring
Tap! five times to find a vein in there

Squeeze 7cc's so I could see the seven seas
And CC all my friends so they could see what I was seeing
But what they saw was a despicable human being
So, I guess they just wasn't seeing what I was seeing
Convert two into one, an indivisible plan
To discover what dreams may come for this invisible man
Sentimental education, beautiful weather
Dam was constantly catching fire
Richard Pryor
Her skin deteriorated
Family infuriated by the myriad of tracks but my train never came
So humiliated, started begging for change
Failed rehabilitation so the scars still remain
Nice clothes became frayed
So isolated and afraid
I smell like an animal my teeth enamel decayed and
I'm relocated in Alabama now
That Maalox and Mylanta now
And it won't stop the burn
Constantly searching for the answers how
I could kiss the sky without enhancing

Pass Juvie-Ju the tooly, that's the chopper, nigga
Drop geekin', hella paranoid, he might air you out
Me and Wes finna take a trip like we goin' out
He violating, he got five fouls, we finna X him out
Can't let new niggas rebound, we gotta box 'em out
Fade, what you talkin' 'bout? We take souls if you want us to
Meet me at the Mobil, gas station, this ain't buyin' two
Bitch endeavor on a touchdown, she said she made like two
Bitch suckin' like a baby bottle, like I got the juice
How is you my brother, but you let him lie up on my name?
Before all the cars, clothes, and chains, I really had some pain
All these niggas girls, really think they in it for the fame
If you gon' last, walk up on me, test his fear of gang
But you out here stealin', hella weird, you ain't with it, blood
You the type of nigga that'll snitch and claim he a thug
Walkin' with this shotty, you know the slugs built like Milk Duds
That was my first pole, I remember I couldn't afford one
Lost a few cutties, on my mama, double back action
Nigga, why you lyin'? You is not active

Turnover, now your partner layin' in the casket
You not movin' packs, goin' broke, I cannot have it
You not payin' for this dick, bitch, you cannot have it
When you catch a charge, makin' statements, it cannot happen
Sit her down, tell her run this play, bitch, I'm Phil Jackson
You know that lil' nine that fit in your pocket, compact action
But I can fit this Draco in my pants, I am not cappin'

With us or against us, you niggas better make y'all mind up
Ayy, I been drinkin' mud, real mud, yeah, that slime, huh?

Joey! Let's go!

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Back in the days before your present
Back when it was a little more pleasant
Before I knew this rap shit would ever lure me in
Let's go back like Mike Fox in the Delorean
Back in the day shit, back to the basics
When brass knuckles used to leave a nigga face ticked
Its back to the Diadoras and the Asics
It's back to the New Edition and The Take 6

[Hook]
""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 2]
Let's go!
Way back if you able to do the math, yeah
I'm talkin' bout the cool table in the cafe, yeah
When the strip was introduced to pedico
Commodore 64 and Coleco
Not back to Cali, back to the valley
Back to Dapper Dan y'all, back to Bally's
Back before Boomerang, Strange'
Before Zhané and go a little further back to Kwame
Damn, we came a long way
[Hook]
""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 3]
I remember break dancing cardboards and backflips
The royal blue and the orange Patricks
Wasn't like you homo suckas
I had the low top Converses, I could change my logo's color
I remember way back when every clan was stylin'
Flava Flav clocks and X-Clan medallions
In class see a girl you glance at her
Pass her a note, do you like me? Circle a answer

""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 4]
Winters not the best time warm it up Kane had came through
The eight ball jackets and Columbia Rain suits
We ain't pay minds to the length of our chains
Transformers was a dance Decepticons was a gang
Y'all I'm talkin bout sheep skins
Talkin' bout wearin' two pair of jeans when moms gave me a beatin'
After school three o'clock we was able to fight
Park dibs y'all two turn tables and mike like
[Hook]
""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 5]
What about when Public Enemy came out and they dropped a classic
Or the Pee-Wee Herman and the Roger Rabbit
And the nerds took our tests and they passed em for us
Back to the roof top back to latin quarters
The olds school's new school now it's the same ol'
It's back to Filas, gazelles and Kangols
It's back to 40 ounces back to OE
Not back to rope chains but back to gold teeth
I was the class clown just snapping at cats
Let's go back to the (?) with the matching hats
Remember the Real Roxanne, remember all the vets
Remember Kool Moe Dee remember Lord Finesse
I bumped Run-D.M.C. almost every weekend
The Bronx and Queensbridge just couldn't stop beefin'
Kept it on wax they ain't have to pack heat
Back to Ron G tapes, back to Black Sheep

Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1
[Verse 6]
Come on say it with me
I'm talking old Bobby Brown before he thugged Whitney
I used bring all my toys in the tub with me
A snotty-nosed kid eating boogers
It was Ultimate Warrior and Jimmy Fly Snuka, uh
Sometimes I read scriptures like Psalms maybe
And I didn't wanna go to church but my moms made me
TV made me laugh
I remember Knight Rider, Kit used to save his ass
Let's go back to spooning back to Black Moon and
Back to when wrestling had its own cartoon and
They used to sleep on us, now they demand us
Will Smith told parents they just ain't understand us
Back to playing the dozens
Back to humping our prettiest girl cousin
Psych! I'm buggin
N.W.A. was simply known
Let's get back on the block I'm talking Quincy Jones
I gotta Jones y'all

""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 7]
Let's go back before I burned the booth
When Tevin Campbell was ill before the whole world learned the truth
Hip hop had a message then, jewels was dropping
I never got what I wanted on back to school shopping
Think about it, used to be about shit
That was back when I still got Easter outfits
We all grew up all older folks
It's more than just the music, it's a culture, folks

""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

Bullet and a Target,rap,Bliss n Eso,2008,"[Intro: Vusi talking]
I believe that together we can really make a difference
One man cannot make a difference, but if we can partner
If we can have a collective will, and a willingness to make a difference in our nation
We can really do make a difference

[Hook: Muzi]
What you have done, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
Won't be long, won't be long...

[Verse 1: Bliss]
All it took was one in a trillion
In a world where they're gunning civilians
Where conspiracies just drop on us like plummeting buildings
Government villains at night, we are renegades who fight
Under a pilgrims plight for a better way of life
See we sail the seas with a sun stained atlas
To escape the day to day mental mundane madness
That consumes us, it's true, though my real answer lays
Is stepping back to view life's real grand Monet
But crucial issues are lost in this crazy worlds wealth
How can lust for bucks outweigh one baby girl's health?
Through the cyclone we hit the Third World and found heroes
With nothing but still everything, smiling at ground zero
[Hook: Connections Zulu Choir]
What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away
What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away

[Verse 2: Eso]
So let the bullets in the air turn to raining rose petals
That covers the Earth's surface while the children throw pebbles
From dreams to themes, to a crack in the concrete
From a seed to a tree, I make it happen at God speed
Whatever happened to increase the peace
Fight the power for people to defeat the beast
Well its right here, its right now, it's anything I plan
It's a poem that proves a point, it's everything I am
So on a rainy day I made my way to the promised land and back
And now its safe to say in a crazy way, this song is where its at
Its equal verse what wasn't given, teachers verse the problem children
Evil verse the honest living, people verse the politicians

[Hook: Connections Zulu Choir]
What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away
What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away
[Verse 3: Eso & Bliss]
This is definite, like the sun will rise
Pure like the thought if I jump I'll fly
I am revolution, my path is belief
So how can they possibly stop what they can't even see
See they tax the poor, their evil got 'em coughing up
There's no real freedom under a legal modern mafia
Set the goal and unite, get cocked and take aim
The people are the power to make change, so make way

[Hook: Connections Zulu Choir]
What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before you're pulling yourself away
What you've done here is put yourself between a bullet and a target

Hip Hop Quotables,rap,Ludacris,2003,"[Verse: Ludacris]
Hi, my name's Ludacris, and I'm high as giraffe pussy
And I'm close to the edge, so your parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids actin' a fool from the traps to the 'burbs
My filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy and put my old teeth back
I take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader
It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
But no pork on my fork, I don't even speak pig Latin
I go fishin' on my lake, with yo bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MCs, but I don't gain no weight
The numba one chief rocka, clean out yo' rap lockers
I'm as stiff as a board, y'all more shook than maracas
But my trix ain't for kids, if you dig'um you'll get smacked
I'll clock ya I'll spring forward, you fall back
Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers
That's cause I'm a shot caller, y'all fools is Crank Yankers
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine
Now I roll up torpedoes, get blunted with rastas
For a hefty fee, I'm on your record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys, I'm a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full-court press (Ow)
So momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash
'Cause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camel's ass
The competition never just wanna admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in The Wash
From yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit'chu
One of Mini-Me's shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
I'm in the strip club smokin' with President Clinton
So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They made the mold of the penis enlarger off me (Me)
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq (Yeah)
So yippie kay yay, yippie yie yie yo (Yo)
If you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro ('Dro)
I've been lookin for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons (Woo)
So wash all your sins away and stop playin' (Yeah)
If God's line is busy you might have to two-way him (Mhm)
Then catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet
And when I'm drunk, tell them kids, ""Drugs are bad, mmm'kay?""?
Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico
Got seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think I'm bad, they say ""Ooh, he's so evil!""
'Cause I go on blind dates with actual blind people (Ow)
But my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf
I heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself
'Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home
All that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them
'Cause Ludacris'll beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in your ass that you can smell it
And your breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellant
I'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see
And I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me, and me
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry
So I'ma trade my earrings in and get a Ferrari (Woo)
I buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump
Y'all meet with Honda, no payments for twelve months (Uh-huh)
Take a look at yo' life, and no wonder you so sad

[Intro]
You on that third eye shit, Huh?

[Verse 1: Dyemond Lewis]
It’s all illusions, fixed gear cruising
Fixed reality shrouded from governmental pollution
I ain’t a saint, the holy ghost up in my aura rebuked it
It’s the era of indigo and they go with the preaching
I ascend as the seasons, go on and I vanish
Cause I notice I’m slowly becoming way more imbalanced
A king with the crown, firm grip on the chalice
Solid gold angel coming back to burn down this Babylon
Has told many tales, his flows you could sells
Mastering wind elements, I move with the gales

[Verse 2: Chuck Strangers]
‘Cause I’m a socialite in the night, bitch get right enable
I’m boxing yo dorm, put my Nikes on the coffee table
My tongue’s below her navel, she makes it wet, her skills are naval
Seals my hands on her extremities, we’re chopping up these remedies
Came in between her and I
We leave it to the constellations like should we continue relations?
I think not cause all I do is smoke pot
And make beats, and yo ass just want back shots
[Verse 3: Dirty Sanchez]
Smoker’s club, Michael Jordan how I’m killing 4 quarters
You stashing the trash, hoarder
Yo girl starting to bath water, it’s Dirty
And that’s not an introduction, it’s nutching
Dirt on my shoulders, like Hova
My niggas turn boulders soft, that’s the shit that me and jovid saw uh
And now its like Pro Era in stores
All my niggas opening doors
All my bitches is braless, flawless more or less
Balance was the key, more action less speaking
Everybody wants a piece
Peace

Check
(Peace)
Yo

[Verse 4: A la $ole]
When I release the flows I goes over yo dome far
The nigga to represent the barrio, we hold bars
I shine further, you sons get in the bogart
You gotta pick yo road, give it a go, keep the point, God
Better with the regis my mind, they manifesting
Beast coast, yea we the pros, you don’t wanna mess with
We leave you breathless, don’t second guess the best who blessed it
Less than yo adolescence when I speak my progression
Bring it down baby
Bring it down baby, uh

[Verse 5: Kirk Knight]
This is what I asked for, asked for
Chilling at my back door, back off, mind tweaking on bath salts
Confuse my intelligence, maybe I’m irrelevant
So eloquent, being riders with a elephant
The higher rank tryna pull a trump card
When I try and do the things, I deserve all respect
Intricit my amount, boy to any amount
To any account, probably I gets em out uh

I can see it through the pyramids
I can see it through the pyramids
I can see it through the pyramids
I must admit, I must admit

[Verse 6: Dessy Hinds]
The mental state with a nigga that was penciled for great
Following schedules, never scheduled for break
But still embrace he'll put ya' neck in a brace
Regular days went to getting paid regular
Respecting the Era where the Era’s been ascending up
Got all types of fans that’s always sending us love
And ex girls that I loved I now offend with a glove
And stayed deeper but still heading above
‘Cause Mr. Hinds always gotta float to let the people know that nigga head is above
Regular sea height, cause they 3rd eye never seen height
Cause only this Brooklyn street light gave me shine to shine for these nights
Came with the free ice to bag bodies on the beat sipes
Bring it down baby
Bring it down baby, uh

[Verse 7: CJ Fly]
Looking for who’s in charge, don’t be shocked, I’m the plug
Get inside like the socket, the surgeon, the sergeant
Energy – I put all in
I’m learning the flaw things
In the storm you stand out, you can struck and stand up
I know how to conduct, feelings electric
Well we’re connected, your buttons are pressing
Can test the reception, I sent you a message
Let me know if you get this, the question

[Verse 8: Joey Bada$$]
Seen it all in the retrospect, took retro steps
Like it’s ’93 still, got ’93 til mic skills
Even got the ecko check
Like for real there no testing, my tribe is not some Tribe called Questions
My professions are not no seconds
To no veterans and they minutes of fame
I’m a menace, insane, minus the brain as I diminish the flame
Make it rain, champagne, 'til it falls down the drain
Got my head up in my dreams
Everything ain't what it be seemin'
Don’t blame me girl, blame my semen
You got good jeans so your inseams made seamless
And off top, you’re ingenious
We took a hit of of the greenest
Now she at most fear on the atmosphere but don't intervene us
Break her body down to the genus if she leaving
She didn’t get the pic and now I see Sophia
She get the tone, sorry Bonita but
Sophia got a applebum
Sophia got a applebum
I’m thinking I should take it home
What you saying?

I could go back to the streets and double that
Start a trucking company, and hire my dogs
But I heard the longer you wait to quit, the higher the fall
And I was chest-deep in this shit
With an army of people dependin' on me
Like, how you gon' quit this here?
You got a family, you got a team, most of all you got your son
And did you say you want that Bentley? That ain't no regular-ass car
Or for nobody with no regular-ass job
Nah; and that new Rolly ain't no regular-ass watch
You know just what you gotta do to get it; go, young nigga, go
And when you reach them current goals, you need to go for even more

[Hook: Iceberg]
Be great, young nigga, be great

[Verse 2: Iceberg]
I swear to God, I told myself this shit when I was at my lowest one day
Real niggas never quit, we adjust and adapt
And you would say that I know magic, I made something from scratch
I'm tryin' to Bill Gate the base, Warren Buffet the crack, Basquiat my art
But I'm lovin' my cash
Rozay say he watched me, all the way up the hill
No matter if you the greatest, nigga, they gon' hate you still
So be great, young nigga, be great
Get your paper; fuck them hoes, you tell them bitches to wait
I'm pullin' capers with these flows, and tryin' to open the safe
I swear to God, you in my way, bitch, I'mma open this K
I try to talk to my little brother, tell him get his shit straight
But that young nigga livin' wild, and that's a whole 'nother case
And I believe a product of a distant dad should have a little more drive
Especially if momma strong-minded, with a little more pride
And it bother me everyday, cause I wanna do more
But a nigga gotta want it, and that's my only lil' bro
[Hook: Iceberg]
Be great, young nigga, be great

[Verse 3: Iceberg]
I'mma back you on whatever, with whatever it takes
So many niggas from my own hometown went pro
To the point if I name 'em all, I couldn't finish this song
I just watch like a proud brother, rootin' them boys
Name-droppin' like hell; I went to school with them boys
On the other hand, I got a lotta niggas doin' time and shit
Some kinda mad cause I been busy, you know grindin' and shit
I'm talkin' twelve-hours-a-day, studio-timin' and shit
Sacrificin' everything, barely vibin' with jit
So if I missed a few phone calls, dog I ain't trippin'
Really I'm probably out here stressin' harder than you tryin' to get it
Hopin' when they let you out, you on some chill-out shit
So you can stay out them crackers face and raise your kids
And be great, tell them shorties be great
Cause they the only true thang that's gon' carry your name
And from my heart I got love for you, nigga, I do
And you gon' have me in your corner long as you keep it true
Just keep your faith, homie..",2436,118484

Like ""Whoa"" lil' mama
It's the second time I'm callin' your number
I ain't chasin', I ain't even no runner
But you know I push the Hummer in the summer
Huh, how you hard to be reached?
I can put you where you hard to be reached
Black sand on the balls of your feet
You can scream ""Ain't nobody gone be 'sleep""
This your own private beach (Haha)
And when it comes to sex
Just a little bit of love and a little bit of that
Baby, push your back where your ribs is at
Share a bowl of crunch berries, how real is that? (Haha)
I'm just jokin' of course
I'm tryin' to put your sex game back on course

Look at they jaws
How'm I supposed to rest, dog?
Scared, I'm on self imposed house arrest

They'd say, ""A wild mother fucker too ill for the law.""

Lotta shit happens, like, being in show business
A lot of shit happens, like, like, I make a lot of money, you know
And I'm really happy about it
And I'm not bragging, I just wanna say something
I make a so—fuck, it's ridiculous
But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say
""Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made""
You know what he'd say? ""You's a lying motherfucker
Joe Louis didn't make that much money
Come in here, get your ass out the house
Coming here with that bullshit,"" hah

Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say ""No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that""
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that

And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

About something but now, but now

Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said ""Democracy is too fuckin' slow""
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

Hurdles,rap,Mr. Probz,2013,"[Produced by Neenyo]

Verse:

It's such a cold world, ain’t it?
When every dream you have is starting to look tainted
Moms ain’t around, she struggles to keep the light on
Them second hand clothes to try on
Toes sticking out the front of your shoes
And all your friends keep laughing all the time but not you
It seems like a thousand years
Must have cried like a thousand tears, but now I’m here
And God knew where to put me
Shit was not sweet, no milk and no cookies
Schools said he ain’t worth the trouble
So I made a few plans and sold a couple grams
Lost a lot of close people on the way
Memories were celebrated the same day
That’s how it goes
I’m in the mud trying to find a rose
So I’m gonna keep
Chorus:

I keep jumping over hurdles, hurdles
I just keep jumping over hurdles, hurdles
Endlessly, I’m just so determined
I won’t let go, I keep jumping over hurdles
Make it eventually

Verse:

I never thought I’d see this
Had them cuff prints embedded in both of my damn wrists
Came from the bottom like I never stood a chance
Went from hugging the block to hearing the crowds chant
And now they talking about the old me and miss him
How we could have made it together but they would never listen
I kept swimming upstream
With a pocket full of nickels and a fist full of dreams
See the clouds go away, my days get sunny
They might have took a shot but they ain’t take shit from me
Standing on my own two, roaming with the wrong crew
Showed how to move when that paper turned funny
But it’s all love, I know I’m right where I need to be
And dedicate this to those who never believed in me
Yeah, to those who never believed

I keep jumping over hurdles, hurdles
I just keep jumping over hurdles, hurdles
Endlessly I’m just so determined
I won’t let go I keep jumping over hurdles
Make it eventually


Ups and downs
I’m gonna keep on jumping until I can’t touch the ground
I know it’s hard but I made it so far, I’ve made it so far
And I don’t know, no
Where I’m gonna go, I keep",2650,113316

See my video on the 'Gram, but they crop it

Watchout Remix,rap,Immortal Technique,2008,"[Intro: Immortal Technique]
You know back in the day, some of y'all
Would shout out Allah's name like he was hostin yo' mixtape
Then after 9/11 you got scared and shut the fuck up
Didn't talk about the demonization of a culture, immigrants, nothin'
Now you show up, talk about we takin' it too far
Die slow! Motherfucker!

[Verse]
Yeah, 100 percent independent, I'm the fuckin' boss
I sold 80,000 off a quotable in The Source
The hood is not stupid, we know the mathematics
I made double what I would going gold on Atlantic
Cause EMI, Sony BMG, Interscope
Would never sign a rapper with the White House in his scope
They push pop music like a religion
Anorexic celebrity driven financial fantasy fiction
Contradiction cause the life we was given resembles life in prison
Fed time with Manuel Noriega
The real Noriega, who did America 100 favors
With Contras, the Shah and the CIA
Movin Escobar's coke through the M-I-A
This is +The 3rd World+ speakin, through a dead man walkin
And everybody talkin 'bout the South takin over
It's true motherfucker, but it's comin over the border
Fuck your chain, my people'll kill you for water
Fuck fans nigga, I got soldier supporters
That'll cut your throat if you strapped with a tape recorder
That's right motherfucker, welcome to the New World Order
Where the truth is always censored by corporate reporters
The government, runs the drug politics on the corner
That's why I never stress rappers and their employers
I put a bag over his fuckin head and torture your lawyer
Cause it's too simple to shoot ya - I'll taser the roof of
Your mouth and electrocute ya, I'll root you out with the Ruger
The German Luger, U-boat, and the troops in the scuba
Nigga you can't overthrow me like the island of Cuba!
Niggas'll never find your body, like the bitch in Aruba
And I maneuver through the state department and their friends
With secret deals like the Nazis and IBM
And now you know this ain't a trend or a fashion
This is my life and my passion, fuck tryin' to cash in, nigga!
I need more than advancements and a rented mansion
So while you little house niggas is singin' and dancin'
I'll kill you and take your land like an Israeli expansion

Niggas ain't never did fly with us
Bitch, my clique notorious
Bet you can't come close to this
I sit in the back of the whip like this
Got a bankroll like I'm still servin' that fish scale
I did a girl in private, she don't wanna hide it
Before you tell your mamma, you need to run it by me
I'm takin' this personal, nigga, like Monica
I do what I want, I go fuck up some commas
I keep a strap on me, Osama, you know I came and conquered
I put the hustle in front of me, you know a nigga a monster
You know a nigga piranha, you know I hop out at any time
And I'm in Chanel and Prada

Got too many racks on me, can't fit in the wallet
Got too much style on me, can't fuck with no stylist

You done sold your soul, you can't do nothin' about it

You in them cuts 'cause that's your hideaway
You at your grandma house, you posted up
You put that chopper on IG
You ready to let it go to make 'em outta believers
You hit your block and get at it
You hit that block and get at it
You used to glorify this life, nigga
Yeah, them niggas took your life, nigga
You see how niggas thinkin' 'bout you?
Now, you layin' on the pavement

Someone died up on that block, well, that's usual
Tried to give you all my love and you used it up

I ain't lyin', my nigga, I'ma be honest

Won't say I shot you in your back, nigga, I just give your ho them
Got niggas from the west side, they change, poor Kim
Nine times out of ten, she gave me brain if shе from Mobile
Still tryna give Sosa all the gamе, I barely know him
Half a mill' up in jewelry, no exaggeration
Half a mill' up in jewelry, no exaggeration
So many nights I fought with demons, you can ask the reaper
Neighborhood Hero, but when it's time, who gon' save the Eagle?
If she put money in my safe, the only way I keep her
Tell the opps to cop out now before this shit deeper
A nigga rock so much of Christian, had to talk with Jesus
It always seem that I be right even when I do assume
I let that Tesla drive itself and that bitch took me to the moon
She ain't got no feelings, she gon' run right through the crew
Nigga, touch my chain, then I'm right back on the news
Movin' like a king but don't scream if they body me
Rappers always steal my flow and don't even acknowledge me
From the streets, I switch the beats, outfit cost at least a key
From the streets, I switch the beats, outfits cost Alicia Keys

Sun up to sun down, we trappin' just like last time

Im Not Racist,rap,Joyner Lucas,2017,"[Verse 1]
With all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin', ""Nigga,"" this, and, ""Nigga,"" that
Call everybody, ""Nigga,"" and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, ""Nigga,"" then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
""They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom""
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear
[Verse 2]
With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, ""All Lives Matter,"" is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, ""Nigga,"" is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
[Outro]
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'

Whatever the topic, let's put it in the frame
We can even load it and cock it and put it in they brains
I'm saying, some rappers do it for a chain
Kill yourself, I know killers that'll do it for some change
These veterans is slipping, they ain't doing it the same
I don't slip, set a pick and put a shooter in your lane
Precise, 'bout shoot them at the range
But I ain't tryna shoot it with you rappers
I'll just shoot it at your dame

Found a new word for weed, that was so mean
I threw it in my name

My song banging loud on the block like arms spraying
The law hating, warring like Blacks and Caucasians
God versus Satan, I'm laying in the dark
With the Mossberg waiting, letting off first basing
Slim from the cotton club washing a scrub
Deuce high when he cruise by, spotting his love
Hold the mic like a .38 muzzle to snub
This flow, call it OJ blood on the glove
Above rap, capital Gs speak on the facts
Please believe that, meaning that I keep it a stack
He's back, he a beast on the track
The only time that I go soft is probably with your freak in the sack

Stack bread when I orchestrate, that said y'all the bass

Come out they shirts sweating bullets with the Bobby Brown jaw
Dry mouth, grinding back and forth plus he's steaming a Newport

Guns that kicked around the wall you better stand tight
Full of X, AKs, whiling in lobbys, bulletproof PJs

On that road, in that '95 SS Camaro hood scoop with the slanted eyes

Getting dome while I drive, trying not to close my eyes
Maintain my focus, don't wanna crash

The Soundtrack...,rap,Cage,2002,"This is the soundtrack to kill your stepfather
Leave the faggot unconscious and douse him in Goldschlager
Light the match, now kick him till he holler
Kick him harder, he only had forty dollars
Jump in your moms whip your face dripping
Leave the tabs alone, no such thing as safe tripping
Bumps of K help explain what's inside you
Look in the rear-view, he's still dragging behind you
Pull it over, you skidded off half his shoulder
Pouring rain you can still smell the blood odour
Think of all the shit he put your mom through
He's half dead, it's already starting to calm you
Tell him to bite the curb then kick till it's heard
Read the papers nerd, stepfather massacred
Start to laugh, you know it's alright
Cause when they questioned your moms you was sleeping all night

Three in the chest, I saw him drop
The only time that I ever called him pop
Two in his back while he's dead on the ground
One more in the head because he made a little sound
Ran out of bullets so I used the blade
Wear rubber gloves cause he might have AIDS
Better call home because I'll be late for supper
Sorry mom, I just killed this mother fucker
Cut school cause you like fuck school
Mom fuck you, I'll throw you in front of a a truck too
Keep my drugs, I can sneak in more
Let's all go rob my stepfather's sneaker store
I got the codes and plus the new shocks in
Nobody's watching so jail ain't an option
Fuck trust, tried to kill my family twice
Stupid mother fuckers trying to raise an anti-christ
I steal from the bitch that shit me in the ditch
And plot the death of the fag that said he'd make her rich
In dish washing gloves, anger starts to flood
At gun point, got mom wrapping the carcass up
See through stab wounds, a barbeque at dad's tomb
Barbeque chicken, I can tell mom is glad too
Meet you in the car, rolled the haze
Rubbing my full stomach while I pissed on his grave

Three in the chest, I saw him drop
The only time that I ever called him pop
Two in his back while he's dead on the ground
One more in the head because he made a little sound
Ran out of bullets so I used the blade
Wear rubber gloves cause he might have AIDS
Better call home because I'll be late for supper
Sorry mom, I just killed this mother fucker
Put me on a PINS petition, man listen
My mom might slip in your blood and die in the kitchen
My hands itching to push the blade then my fist in
Pop out your back knocking your spine out of position
Parts missing while they scoop you off the ground
The class clown ready to pull the mask down
Empty the gun, then it's time to reload
Mapping out his murder, pissing for my P.O
Get home, he's on the couch running his mouth
Walked up to him and put his own gun in his mouth
Painted the wall, he's still standing waiting to fall
Heard a car pull up, I shoud've stayed at the mall
But I'm sick of getting treated like a god damn step child",5580,74821

Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved

Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?

And tell me where that AUX cord is I might slap some Gucci, get it lit

Oh I need hella women
We just wanna live like a television
American dream that, Wu Tang Cream
Said her car's in the shop, she's still stuck on eat
Give me a large Aquafina and a ten on three
That should get us to the Biddy, my part dose of acid got me trippy
I'm from Berkeley, I might be a hippie
I can never trip cuz I got riders rolling with me
Rolling logs big enough that we can float to Mississippi

Streets Raised Me,rap,Mobb Deep,1999,"[Intro: Havoc]
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, that true shit
That shit to make you feel shit
To all my niggas and my bitches
Yo, check it, uh huh

[Verse 1: Havoc]
It's kinda bug how I dose sometimes; know they staring
Brain feels like a wheel lost without the ball bearing
Stuck, contemplating who I can trust
But like llello in a bill my feelings just get crushed
But thats why I stick with my duns, like I stick with the guns
Don't get mad, rip your hun, concentrate on my funds
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist
Never get patted down when I step in the place
Jiggied up, scope the spot, confirm beef, if it's not
Bally up, after this get followed straight to the crib
Gem star, double edge apply pressure
Shave 'em down, blow marks intruding through your mecca
Wanna be a thug, now you got the thug look
Stick 'em up, leave Medicaid with the bill to foot
God-Body, with a rubber grip black shottie
Pump one in that ass make a nigga switch hobbies
A dosage, hand delivered, without postage
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice
Niggas get sniped like, clog your bronchite
Show 'em how to rock right, when bitches are holdin mics

[Chorus: Chinky (Prodigy)]
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say
Forever you a part of me (street life)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
I'm surprised we alive today, today
For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me

[Verse 2: Big Noyd]
This is something you feel nigga, like the theme song from Hill Street Blues
This is real, this is ill street news
How he gone, and left his moms mind struck
And now his brother not giving a fuck
Little sister giving up the butt now, dun don't wet that
I want you to rest black, 'cause you can believe that Noyd gon' handle that
Cause when I get 'em, I'm gonna have 'em
Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at 'em
I'm no killer, you know me
But I'll be damned if I don't ride for my co-D
And then this OG, scold me, and told me, coldly
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homie
But I, gotta redeem, get this cream by any means
I never been clean
Nigga, my whole click got dirty
From the vials, to the trials and the bloodied up syrtie
Nigga you heard me, it's gangsta (and to the block)
[Chorus: Chinky (Prodigy)]
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete

For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Vision the canvas I paint a picture
Similar to Ernies Barnes, nigga
But mines is more ghetto more guns
More drugs, mostly thugs
All my dunns, their baby moms daughter and sons
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out
Park benches is broke, a nigga stretched out
Jumped off the roof and fell to his death, it's real
Hand Ball walls displayed with R-I-P murals
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building
Devil's Spring, keep 'em going while the snows blowing
Grams get dipped, 50's is moked, cookies is broke
And Spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off, don't get clipped off
(Street life)
[Chorus: Chinky (Prodigy)]
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete

Got a new car, did that, 2x so I can't sit back
And I'll be damned a nigga blam me and I ain't seen my kids' kids yet

Don't be tryna let 'em know I'm thug, but I'm mean muggin' shit

Every time I open don't nothin' but nasty shit come out
Listen bitch to this story about
A young nigga comin' straight from the fuckin' south
I'm 6'6"" slangin' dick Alabama style
Fuck a bitch and call her a ho and kick her out the door
Bitches like it when a nigga talk nasty to 'em
Beat they ass and take they cash
And them project hoes I don't trust 'em
Niggas fall in love with them but everybody fuckin' 'em
I'm talkin' national hoes until I die
A bitch can't respect herself so why the fuck should I?
Say yes ma'am or call you a lady
Take you out to dinner bitch you got to be crazy

And on check baby bitch got a lot around the house
Niggas waitin' to stick they dick up in the bitch mouth
All you silly hoes and food stampers
You gettin' your hair fixed you need to be buyin' some pampers
Your babies ain't had shoes in a year

Diamonds in your motherfuckin' ears
Bitch you gets no respect
Since you ??? me to kick your ass clean out the projects
I feel sorry for your babies
They can't help it if they motherfuckin' nanny just plain lazy
Dirty dishes in the sink cuz they ain't been fed
And they sleepin' in a pissy ass bunk bed
Five other kids five different daddies
Little bad motherfuckers throwin' rocks at my Caddy
I still give 'em change everytime I see 'em

But won't go to the store to steal a can of milk
They wanna blame it on they baby daddy

Well, my, hat brim might be worn a little too low
You're too slow, what the fuck do you really think you know
I do so, and every rhyme that I spit is just so crucial
Like Metamucil, I kill some rhymes that I'm used to
You park so high and mighty, but I'm not mighty high
Duddy smoke you out with weed and leave your mouth fucking dry
Cause some of them rappin', clappin', laughin'
Always beer tappin', fuckin' dorkette slapping
Be ridiculous at how I'm trippin'

I shine like some moonlight through the pine
Yo, and even if you were wine
I'd still stay dope up with my line

Well if you generally irie
Then roll with the stylie
Duddy ""smokin' Cali green leaf 'til I die"" B
Leave me alone when I'm chilling in my home
Yo, I'm smooth like a Schwinn and I shine like the chrome
Of its fender, remember this microphone defender
Return your shit to sender cause no one wants to hear it
Yo, your lyrics are weak and yes your spirit's meek
And you an ignant motherfucker, yes it shows when you speak
You're a wicked disappointment, your rhymes need some ointment
The crowd at your shows always laughing and pointin'
Leavin' and blewin', my boy has been groovin'
And I'm still backstage just smokin' and boozin'
Confusin' the sets, save the best for my choosin'
I'm choosin' the rest so you're losin'

Well, don't forget about the down and dirty southern Cali flow
Just open the melody and let the rhythm go
I'm hoofing up the track just like a bouncing antelope
And soften up your Skoal just like a ripened cantaloupe
Because the west (west) coast (coast) knows how to kill it
Yo, and y'all (y'all) know (know) when its time to feel it
Yo, we make it right (make it right)
So we up all night (up all night)
Until it's tight (until it's tight)
Until it's tight (until it's tight)

With lyrical chastity and verbally blasphemy
The illest we have to be, with musical masterpiece

Once upon a time in the neighborhood
There was a little dirty boy that was up to no good
He had a chip in his tooth and a mic in his hand
He had a dirty-ass head from the beach and the sand
He said, I just got out of the water and I'm late for school
I asked Duddy to skip and he said, that's cool
So we went to the liquor store, got ourselves some Magnums
Rollin' down the street, yeah, you know we brown bagged 'em
With the 50s on top and the 20s on bottom
Said we rollin' through my hood, yeah, you know we got 'em
Sucker MCs wanna battle me, but that's okay
I tell 'em, don't fuck around because we don't play
I sang rock out with my cock out, I got balls of steel
Hear me clanking down the street like a bag of beer
Said the dance off session, gonna start right here
Duddy B, grab the wheel, cause I can't steer
You got 20-inch rims and they spinnin' when you stop
Said I don't give a fuck, kill it when the beat drops
Cause that's what I respect, to all you knuckle heads and derelicts
Just jammin down the sound with the syllables and intellect
Maybe not the intellect, but the syllables are clean
And I leave you in the desert with an empty canteen
While I be rippin' shows from here to Galapagos
And I be pickin' foes like I'm pickin' a fro

This that shit you bob your head to
This that brand new instrumental
I heard he puts his city on
That boy Kells so influential
Success got everybody hating
Success to me is inspiration

If don't nobody that looks like us makes it?
You only got one life, don't waste it
I mean we only got one night, get wasted
I mean I know you're trying to think it out
But go with what you feel cause real problems can't be calculated
It's hard to find the answer when they have no explanation
It's hard to find where you're headed when there's no destination
It's hard to know when we're going when there's no expiration
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long

Drinking whiskey like a desperado
My bitches drinking Reposado
Ashing in an empty bottle
Listening to the songs that put our asses in this empty condo
Remember ridin' 'round in Ashleigh's car though?
When the radio first played our song though?
Or at her house when MTV first showed my face
That clip was crazy, I swear it felt like we won the lotto
But a million bucks can't buy priceless moments
An a million people may not know us
But every one of us wants this gift we own
And that is: how is how to keep it real
How to never judge somebody by their steering wheel
Cause you know that mother fucker in that Ford Taurus
Could be the next mother fucker in that new Porsche
But like I said it's hard to know where you're headed
When there's no destination
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

This shit right here, man, this shit feels right! Aye Dub! Aye Dre! Aye Irv! you know it’s all year right? Hah! I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City, the night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka, with my boys, and I’m thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday, and the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals. And you know, the crazy part is, Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York. I think she had to some work some shit or something, so she couldn’t go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about. And I’m driving us there, but my license’s suspended so I tell Slim, I'm like “Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch, so you can drive in case we get pulled over"" cause we got pulled over the last time we went there. But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later, I'm pulling over in this emergency lane and right as I’m opening the door to switch with Slim, boom! This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us. Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body’s laying outside the car in the ditch, like 15-20 feet away from where we just were. The car was totalled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside, but we were actually okay. I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright, but our meeting’s with the record label started at 2 and we didn’t have no car, and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey. So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name’s James McMillan, he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway. I don’t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could’ve died a couple of hours ago but I'm in there and like you know I’m not feeling this shit man I’m not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to Cleveland. Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know, I'm on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she’s like “Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now."" I’m like, ""who?” She’s like “He’s gonna call you in 30 seconds."" Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise cause this dude named Byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video I had called “Chip off the Block” over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff, so I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear: “Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you."" I said, god damn, life’s about to change, man, I felt it. And sometimes thats all it takes, it’s just that feeling you know what I mean. I knew I was gonna be here, and now I’m here

Feel that, uh

Look Like,rap,Charlie Sloth,2014,"[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
This is what it looks like from inside out
When it's time to go to war and your men ride out
Then the money start coming in, you can't hide out
So you switch and get on the ready to die route
The hole you dug for yourself is getting deeper
Them hoes you love is just making a thug weaker
You seed now, you don't get the buzz off the reefer
It was only the fuzz, now you running from the reaper
Death toll rises, sleep without closing your eyelids
Still reppin' both sides in Hackney
East London get live in
Until Speedy come home, we grindin'
Went from one horse to another, we shinin'
Ha, it was all good timin'
Yeah, but we still living the crooks life

What it look like, money what it look like
What it look like, honey what it look like
What it look like, cuh what it look
What it look like, yuh what it look like

What it look like, honey what it look like
What it look like, they wonder what it look like
What it look like, what it look like
[Verse 2: JMC]
It look like more gold around my neck than a Versace shirt
I've got that chick doing that Rihanna twerk
Brothers hate me and my brothers
Cause the chicks they love, love me and my brothers
Couple Nickis, menaging under covers
Couple cameras, no Big Brothers
A couple niggas really see my grind
So they won't begrudge me in a DB9
Forget the limelight, all I do is grind right
Cause I already done seen too many nine nights
The industry nearly tried to blackball
Cause my sound underground like black wool
[?] lit up like Keano's
The food on the menu is kilos
In the kitchen, trying to cook a blizzard
Trainers DNA of a Lizard

[Verse 3: Jadakiss & JMC]
Y'all already know we getting them stacks
In the UK all we doing is bridging the gaps
So I'ma fly you over
So we can talk business on the white cliffs of Dover
In a black Range Rover
Customs will search you, they try to hurt you
We got a lot of pill and I ain't talking 'bout the purple
I'm on the Isle of White, sittin' on a Iisle of white

[Verse 4: Stormzy]
Started from the bottom and I'm still here
Know we started picking cotton, shit is real here
Hit the target when I spot 'em, I go hard, have you forgotten?
I walk over to the problem, ""what's the deal here?""
Niggas fuckin' kill it, told 'em it's the come up
Started off by doing robberies and run ups
All that talking's gonna make him lift his gun up
Now all that talking went and got your bredrin bun up
0 to 100, zero on the budget
It don't cost a thing to make your baby mother plug it
Niggas hate my lyrics but their baby mothers love it
You just bring her down, I come around and give her courage
You just bad her up, I come around and give her rounds
Niggas standin' up, I come around, they're sitting down
Yeah I've had enough, add it up I figured out
You didn't listen to me then, bet they listen to me now

The Day,rap,The Roots,2010,"[Hook: Patty Crash]
When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

[Verse 1: Blu]
Yeah, it's like everyday I wake up, I stare into space and don't say much
Peer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up
Coffee pots, cigarettes, morning J's, Baileys
Slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
Beats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs
Feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
And plus the toxins I sip got me tall
Still tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles
Every day is like a blank canvas
Carving my initials in the planet like I brand it
Hand picked to live this life we take for granted
Like a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it
Smiling through the trouble we face, tryna manage
My way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
Cause I can sit on my ass or just imagine
The madness I did on my path and paint the canvas
[Hook: Patty Crash]
When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Before I rise and shine like a neon sign
I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein
And burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton
It's my only bonafide break from these confines
I need a change of scenery like a montage
These kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad
And everybody coming at me from the blindside
I'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide
I listen to some theme music on the iPod
And walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise
Feeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline
I got to try different things in these trying times
2010 is different than it was in '9-5
It's come alive time, I picked a fine time
For getting open off life like a fine wine

[Hook: Patty Crash]
When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
[Verse 3: Phonte]
Uh, yeah, Sunday morning, plan my day out
Whole new blueprint, brand new layout
Deep down still don't know if it'll play out
But for the first time, feel like I done found a way out
Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight
Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith
Troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
Chicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base
But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase
And I finally understand my right to choose
My preacher man told me it could always be worse
Even the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
So you can stop and refresh the rules
Breathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds
Something inside said that's the move
And maybe today I'll restart fresh and new

[Hook: Patty Crash]
When I wake up, I look into the mirror

The Substance,rap,Aesop Rock,1997,"[Chorus 1]
Four rooms, a ceiling and a floor but there's more
(Close to insanity)
A desk with a subtle light, a window, and a door
(Close to insanity)
One bottle of the bluest inks your iris ever saw
(Close to insanity)
One child prodigy with a vision in his core
(Close to insanity)

[Verse 1]
I'm frost bitten, slippin' away titanic burden nurses
Where the anti-hero clergy purge their value burning service
And warped was I, huddled beneath the influence of fresh
Meshed with impressions that appear to shrink before my very breath (Breath)
These tides of woe and malice and mirth initiate a wave crash
Splashing my offspring graves prior to birth, it's looking bleak (Bleak)
Malarkey farce sergeant crooked and sleek emerald eyes glow
I'm shook in a freak side show!
OK, I strobe effects projective when I blink, so I design this chorus line
When linked we let our eyelids fall and pilots stall
With what I sing, I'll open lash light and dark clash to dim the wattage
Then see the wide-eyed dried raising supplied fiery Colossus
Well, I am a hostage, guiding, yet, pushed beneath the craze's climate
Hiding behind the levy while the stubborn rivers rise and feel this
I wish heavenly brevity centered hate pedigrees instead of dead serenity
God damn, must have remembered me
It clenched me, it wrenched me, tempted me to employ it
Apprehended me and rendered me suspended in its voyage
How these tables have turned!
Hand to the bottle with the skull and crossbones scribbled off the label, sip the ladle, drank the burn
Begging for death, concerns off with a zephyr tread and leg in a web
Caught triple-six couriers; beckon, they fled
OK, OK, I get it; let 'em shake a little, then release 'em
Like, as if ghostly hysterics would leech on band aid completion
Odium, patience ran his anti-death commando
Just a litigant stretchin' to touch tranquil, but couldn't quite catch the angle (Yeah)
I'm trained as cornerstone famine trooper
So my tray within a heart of hearts still belly up and parched, come on (Yeah, yeah, check it)
[Chorus 2]
I'm a sideline observer alerted not yet retreating
(Close to insanity)
The climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing
(Close to insanity)
Now everybody in the populace awaited my reply
(Close to insanity)
I spit a billion tiny brilliant white lights into the sky
(Close to insanity)

[Verse 2]
Undeniably amused by the way the fuse burn
By the way the clues churn in front of my eyes
To fertilize germination of concern for me, for we
For he who's sucked into the trench, fully dug, I don't wanna pull the plug
Hug on my canteen like in a dream
Centipede leader speedin' through a meaty greed league
I can tell by the way the needs bleed from a seed
If the breed should have ever been bred, 'nuff said
Whether compared to caterpillar and cocoon to emerge
Or a spark's soon to bloom to a surge
All I need is the nourishment, the courage and the burn
To ascend from a number, to brave Blade Runner
Hunter, cleric, swordsman, king
More like I'm walking with a broken mood ring
Mood swingin' from the mezzanine level, here to bevel the edge
My team's settled on the ledge to pledge, it's like that
[Verse 3]
In the summer it rains buckets of hunger pains
In the winter it's the same, with an added climate change
The remaining two quadrants balance the polar values equally for mid-range
Yet the songs of thirst remain the same
You could turn the whole cold reservoir to liquor
Hell, split the ocean on its seams if it boosts your esteem
I never lend span of attention lest my brethren signal fresh
So do your magic, miracle worker, or I'll remain unimpressed
For the flux, the fix, the famine
For the fact that little Billy up the block obtained a lovely hand cannon
I'd examined auto-pilot (Right) when filibuster won (Yeah)
Concluded the few we're tuned with were now targets of his movement (Oh shit)
It's intriguing, yet, I guess, I knew somewhere, something was leaking, now I honor instinct, delinquent
Bring settler runaways, frayed boogie bastard clicks
To bypass glass stature, walking graft characters
Militant dance split the sun and sip the filament
Tracer; vivisection is to lab rat primes
They try to grace these sacred lips with his maze or a dirty wine
He knew, he brewed the substance just to mock the lesser budgets
Then sought off all trickery, bought off the public, and screamed victory!
Tunnel through the mite infested grillage and the rig
As fast as Aesop and his ten little fatigued fingers could dig
Trigger revenge, tip the goblet in the dirt, review my words
Spit in the puddle, peace to fame, struggle the fuck out, and duck out (Yeah, check, huh, uh)
[Chorus 3]
Now, all hail defenders of the trash talk
(Close to insanity)
I was hidden, yet I slid in just to rip the mask off
(Close to insanity)
I'm seventy-six inches of all the purest sounds
(Close to insanity)
So y'all could dig me six feet deep my eyes would still be over ground!

Can't believe I repeated a lyric and Devilman didn't say ""said that already blood""
Why you repeating it, I woulda' been finished, out of all my lyrics I spat that twice
Anyway fuck that, talk about me you better hashtag grime
Crowd went mad when I spat that rhyme, everybody went mad when I spat that rhyme
Turned up late, black man time, all black suit and it's Batman time
Think that you're me but you're not that guy, vintage shirt but you're not that fly
Feds seen me on the TV and they're like ""Can't believe we never stopped that guy""

Had something special like ice and tea
Compatible despite their ethnicity
And differences they were meant to be

You can fall in love with, care for and see the world with

I've struggled to find anything that I like
We had something special
I'm sorry that I couldn't see that now

Seeking reason, what is the meaning
This life is deceiving
Yeah, I know that we weren't perfect
But if it's easy it's fucking not worth it

Stuck in the trap, gotta clear this pack
Everyday, chase bands, gotta up that stack
Facts, the opps ain't bad, just chat
I don't know these yutes that jumped on tracks
This is more than rap, don't talk 'bout dead it
Step for a M, add a K on the opps if I beat this one that I step with
Reckless, all of my bros done cheffings
Slip, you're pissed, fling corn where your 'ead is
Duck and dive when these bells get spreaded
Fatal wounds and they can't get mended, mended
If it weren't done by gang, it was done by the 3rd or my Latimer members
Made their dargs dem run like Bolt, some pattys

Mash come old like grandad Ratty

Got a course in pushing this weight, no I'm not in a gym when I'm getting these gains
I don't know how they talk my name, their friend dem dead so they put them on chains
And I done left stains in my Gucci bag cah my blade didn't have no case

It's funny how everybody thinks they know me
Didn't talk to me in highschool, now you want to get to know me?
Well, I guess that's cool
But most people from my school are either stuck up bitches or dudes acting like fucking tools
I'll take a hater, make him grab on my rope
Tell him “I'll take him to the top, just put that rope around your throat”
Then when we get up there, I'll dangle him from the stairs
His dumbass still be like, ""What the fuck is going on here?""
Many don't want to get me started
To the people I hurt, I'm sorry
I really hope that I can still come to your pity party
Nobody's safe, so everybody duck for cover
I don't really give a fuck, but that's just cause I got no rubber
I must be a fucking asshole with this shit coming out of my mouth
Fuck with me, you might come home to a guy with a clown ass on your couch
I'm just kidding, maybe not; I'm the shit I'm gravy hot
And I'm so horny, but I got no lube, so I'll just use some applesauce
Hate me all you want, but talent man you know I have it
I'm like the white Lil' Wayne mixed with a bit of Bob Saget
Huh that's what people say I'll jump on a boat and sail away
And now I'm on an island where they're sharks and all the skies are gray
I'm just so tired of these dumb ass bitches, they
Come home, the dad at work and the mom in the kitchen
Log on to Facebook, putting up a status they
Bitching about how much they hate their lives
When their families the richest
How many problems do you really think that you have?
Your biggest last week was whether you should buy a new cat
Now spit it homie move back
Enough balls to fill two sacks
And they say “You're a rapper? When you gonna get a new tat?”
Well, why you try to put me into a box?
They say I'm acting crazy, just haven't been sleeping a lot
Now all my dreams turn to nightmares, where I only have five hairs
And pull em' out, listening to a dumb bitch and a tight pair
The way these girls act, man it makes me sick
They're starving always searching for attention and shit
And when you're going to work girl, don't upload a pic
And when you're brushing your teeth girl, don't upload a pic, shit!
Nobody really cares that much about your life
I'm sorry, I'd rather watch a fly eating pie, than to
Look at pictures from every second of your life
It's like my newsfeed is a pool, and your trying to drown my eyes
People always hate, so I ask them what they don't like
They say, “I haven't listened to you, but I heard you're alright
But if I listened is just probably something I wouldn't like.”
And I'm just like,“shut up slut, you're a drunk mess, right?”
You really are a hoe and girl you can't deny it
'Cause I just over heard you talking bout' a dirty pirate
And how you swore it how you still have it under your eye lid
And how the guy was big and hairy and his name Was Titus
Hating on other rappers, yeah that ain't me
So many people talk about no way he's better than me
But when yo' albums both dropped, he sold tons of CD's and then you?
You sold none, how are you better than he is?
See, promote yourself, that's all part of the game
You say you have killa' lyrics, but yo' songs aren't playin'
And then you blame it on the fact that he gets radio play?
Stop whining and all just grind or get out of the game
I have to admit, I do talk myself over bit
But, that's only because I know one day I'll actually live it
Mazer with it, always going cause there ain't no
Finish, so if you tryna stop me, you better become a winner
Now, love how people talking shit are the ones
That have no potential and all of them will copy
Me with a lyrical pencil
Fuck it, I'll be happy if you wanna be me, I mean I am a
Cool rapper working towards a degree. Gee
I'm kinda flattered, my heart is going “pitter-patter”
Thinking bout' going to college just to become a rapper
I'll do whatever, who cares what I do?
So I sit in the back of class writing raps 'cause they good
This girl was like, “Hey Mark, or should I call you Witty?
I heard that you're a rapper, do you record in the city?
And aren't you from the suburbs? I bet your music is shitty
'Cause I know tons of other rappers and they all film pretty
You're probably just another freck rapper trying to get big
Well, I know rappers from the city that sounds better than big
I haven't heard them, but that's what they tell me and shit
Good luck on your career, I hope I wasn't being a bitch!”
First off, um, never fucking label me!
And girl you're so fake I thought that you were fucking make-believe!
Save your luck full of b when it's only 8 degrees
I don't really care if some dumb bitch wants to hate on me
What else is on my mind?
I think I'm running out of time
I'm already four pages deep inside my little book of rhymes
Hold on! I see the finish line
But, I still have a little time
To fat right lines and show you all I can fucking rhyme, yeah
You wanna talk behind my back?
I hope you like the view back there
You should be kissing my ass
I rappin' slow, I rappin' fast, I do it new
And fuck the past
And I'm schooling anyone that isn't going to class

Bottle,rap,Dead Players,2013,"[Jam Baxter]
Oi shh
The largest thing you've ever seen
Multiplied a thousand times
Doubling in size each second of every hour twice
Re-inflated daily by a legion of the deepest lungs
Still couldn't cast a single shadow on what we become

[male voice]
Oi Baxter why you bleeding son?

[Jam Baxter]
I'll tell if I knew myself
Super stealth jets are crashing in my mind the future melts
Pilots parachuting out my teeth and bursting into flames
And landing on a petrol sodden sound scape we bring the pain
What?
Think I'm lying? (No)
Like the carbon copy kittens writtens dripping fraff about the crack they're still supplying
Bruv' I sold drugs for years and I was fucking awful at it
If I still did it, I wouldn't hot it up by talking damage
Damn its late, watch it all evaporate (wooooooh!)
Yam a fake sugar spewing sewer moving rattle snake
The accolades I'm saving for my heads that understand the journey (wooooooh!)
Tryna murk with you were born to get the planet dirty
[CHORUS}
I don't really wanna hear 'em talk now
Cos they don't wanna hear us kick the door down
How much of this bottle should I pour out?
How about all of it? All of it, All of it, All of it
Jammin' in the league with my feet up
And my whole damn teams looking lean up
How much of this scene can we eat up?
How about all of it? All of it, All of it, All of it

[Jam Baxter]
Watch all of it twist like contortionists
Kicking up a fine fuss
Fuck getting caught in this
Next mans web of lies, eight legged lunatics
A couple grubby bars turn pursuers into fugitives
Yeah, and its all clicking into place (wooooooh!)
Winner takes all of it as all of 'em disintegrate
See every single figures faced with us given time and charmer
Amuse the mind and human eyes of your reclining master

[Dabbla]
And I'm the silent partner
The fire starting suicidal martyr
Who'd like to welcome you to my disaster
Just an ordinary man tryna' find the answer
And I can cut you with my hands but the eye's are faster
Nineteen seven thousand feet
Flying charter
Dropping bombs on the dance floor, find your partner
Come we sing a song of bygones, sayonara
And give me something I can vibe on
Like the la-la
[Chorus]

[Dabbla]
They say that imitation is the greatest form of flattery
Love to see you fakers try and copy man exactly
Dabbla keep it running like an every lasting battery
Don't ever try and class me in a category
Or ask me what the matter be
Matter fact its happening, snappily
Welcome to the Dead Players faculty
Never could you tackle me
As for looking at me like you know me
Yer' I owe you something and for looking back at me
The game in the vanacamy
Keep a kitty catting in the cattery
Kill a catalogue cause a catastrophe
In all of your anatomy
Nothing but debauchery and blasphemy
Talking bout it acting all irrationally
How boring can a rapper be?
Actually, Actually factually
I hope your fam are bleeding from the apathy
Needs to be and has to be
For looking manufactured from the factory
I'll slap you and your strawberry daiquiri
More than satisfactory
Naturally epitome of staying real (wooooooh!)
We ain't in the same feel Motherfucker
Everything we touch is getting flame grilled
You ain't even part boiled
Our soil
Snooping on you losers like gargoyles
Run the rally from up in the valley, never shabby
Get the gally we paddy picking to get the tally
Whose ya' daddy kabaddy the cat is out the baggy
We get 'em aggy from Waltham Abbey to Abu Dhabi

Bitch I'm on my own, she gon' dome me till we home

I don't need no chopper, make it rain on my own
I don't use the 30, I just bought a 50 drum
He just brought a 50 drum
I got bricks in the trunk so we ridin' cautious
Diamonds on my neck, you know they wet they like a faucet
Shotty in my closet, 12 gauge
I been playin' wit guns since like 6th grade
Since I was a youngin', all I did was make plays
I just do this shit for all the bitches that be hatin'
Just don't play with me, cause a nigga get impatient
All we do is play with Glocks and AKs, we be waitin'
I can't go to court no more
Told my mom that I can't work a nine to five anymore
Told myself I need a Rari and I need a fuckin' Porsche
I remember sellin' dime bags off my fuckin' porch
I ain't never sell no dime bags, I was kickin' doors
I told momma I'm not goin' to no court anymore
I don't wanna get arrested, I just wanna fuck these whores
I just wanna get the big bankroll and a Porsche
Keep a shooter with me like Ray Allen
Fucked her then I passed her like and alley

How I took over the game, they don't even know it

Money, flowing
Henny, pouring
Ice on, my neck, like it's, snowing
Yeezy's, glowing
Easy, going
Had to boss my life up, I needed a promotion
Funny how they don't remember all the bad times
Look straight in the mirror say this was my last time
Swear to God that I could do this with my hands tied
I like asparagus and chicken that is pan fried
Told my chef hook it up, whole gang in the cut
Had to cut they down, wait can't let the fame build me up
They gon' hang me out to dry if I don't make another one
I know my brothers with me dog, I love 'em like my mother's son
Working like a sweatshop, I refuse to be a bum
Eatin' I won't leave a crumb
Even when the season done
Leave it up to me and I'mma keep it up, I'll teach you somethin'

Cartier that sit on my face like I need glasses
I'm on the road to my dream, come chase with me
Forward lifestyle, work hard, stay busy
I got, more bounce to the ounce in me
Proud of my brother's success, I live without envy
In a time where they wanna divide us
Things get dark, feel like no one can guide us
Don't feel alone, don't be afraid, don't let them demons get you
Keep your mentality, be silent, and remain official
Make your reality a product of a focused vision
Move on the low, watch who you trust because these niggas be bitches
I talk to God, he see my heart, and now I feel a difference
I got examples 'round me either dead or they in prison
I use my voice to shine a light and see a better Richmond
And then a whole world, I'mma keep it so thorough, ay

Worldwide Cypher Takeover,rap,CHVSE,2020,"[Intro: KXNG Crooked]
Yo, whaddup y'all, it's your man, KXNG Crooked
Check it out
You know what I'm about
I'm about the bars
I'm about the talent over politics
I'm about the culture
That's why I want y'all to check this new cypher out
It's the Worldwide Cypher Takeover
About to takeover the world with these bars
Let's watch

[Verse 1: GAWNE]
Let's talk about them subpar gun bars, gats and Glocks
Only strap that you got is your Apple Watch
If you're the worldwide cypher then
Youtube Volume 2 must've been rapped by some astronauts
'Cause this ain't worldwide, intergalactic
Got that bird's eye view over Earth likе the moon, what the fuck can I do?
Uh, this ain't nothing new
I came out the womb a killer like Goku
Them flows were so smooth, steady fed 'em soul food
This that old school era from nineties to '02
Potent fumes if you step in my room 'cause CO2
Smokes floor to ceilin', fillin' the whole booth, you're old news
Talkin' 'bout an L, but my Spotify's seven times bigger than those two
So, oh shoot, that was never beef, it was tofu
When steppin' in my arena, you get eatin'
No competin' when it comes to making good fuckin' music, I shine through
Bitch, let me remind you
Shady Records, Slaughterhouse, cosign what I do
So I pay no mind at the hatin' kind and the lazy guys
Where they go and get paid for the way that I take a line and I break it down eighty-nine times
Make it around so hot that my face is straight on fire used to pray to God
Till I became one, now I'm way on top, motherfucker, we ain't gon' stop, nah! (Hah!)
Ain't no one better than me, I'm a veteran, pen is elite
Every centimeter of the beat is defeated, I beat it up, eat it like bon apètit when we go to the feast
I'm a predator, y'all are just meetin', yeah, speakin' of beef, you're figurin' they're weak and vegan
I'll leave 'em with teeth in the spleen, and then they get to wheezin' and chokin', can't breathe (Brrt!)
Shoot my shot, Tory Lanez, up until his story changed
I don't shoot at feet, I leave a gory brain
Dark and messy, got 'em I'm sleepin' like narcolepsy
Till the narcs catch me
In the booth, more bars than a benchpress machine
Yeah, my words carry weight, cartels, I ain't talkin' barbells, uh
Claimin' that they killed it, but the beat was playin' possum shit
Me and all the squad now really made it posthumous (Yeah)
[Interlude 1: GAWNE]
Yeah
It's the motherfuckin' takeover... bitch

[Verse 2: CHVSE]
I'm tellin' artists it's stupid, they're tryin' cross with me (Huh?)
All for the king to a god but I got 'em on a tee (Tee)
Teeth hurt, y'all are too fake, need some Oral B (Huh?)
Y'all ain't gettin' laid, you get laced up if I'm on the feet (Brrat!)
Morbidly obese, personas will go to war with me ([?])
Fat boy, hungry for views, this dude will start a beef
Just so we could eat, brought the fire, I'll supply the grill
If I don't kill him on the beat, I know his diet will (World Wide League)
Better with me, just get up and leave (He's my bitch)
Get on your knees (Bars my prison), son of a bitch
Made my shiv with the ice on the wrist, tellin' my bitch I'ma kill her for streams (O. J. Simps')
All on my feed (Shift it and run), only go freeze (Ah!)
Flow is colder (Yeah), y'all ain't meet the quota (Nope)
Soldiers turn to fruit as soon as me and Grizzy rollup (Haha)
Barrin', hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, sick of signs you throw up
I show 'em up 'cause at they shows, not a soul would show up (Damn)
Callin' me the Em clone? You're losin' yourself
That's career suicide, homie shootin' himself
Because the dudes who got shooters could tell
You ain't a shooter yourself, dawg, be true to yourself (You pussy)
You a bitch, never hit the streets (No)
I said I'd never fight a pussy, I just flick the bean (Brrt)
Man, I didn't intervene when you dissed my dawg
So be gettin' me and take it with a grain of salt, you bitch (Ah!)
[Verse 3: DKRapArtist]
Man, I'm excited to write this track
Mum lost her house, I made a promise to buy it back (I'll buy it back)
And I ain't gonna let her down, I'm just climbing up through the ranks
And I bet that she's looking down like, ""Thank fuck that he good at something"", uh (Thank God)
I made it out of the house that was full of roaches
The clothes that I never chose but got handed down
My emotions were so overloaded, I could have overspoken at any moment
Took the path of drugs and just overdosed from a lethal dosage
All the chat about having gats in the trap, we don't condone it (We don't)
You got kids that look up to you and you still promote it
Glorifying killing and shooting people for any motive
Like murder is cool? Man, that shit is bogus
Enough of the chat, police are kicking the door of your flat, you've got to stash
'Cause you've got coke on the table, plus there's more in the back, fucked in a flash
Don't want to waste your life, especially not for the cash
Time is all I want 'cause I know it's the one thing I won't ever get back, yeah
You don't wanna be always running from sirens
Locked away, doing time, and stay surrounded by violence (No, you don't)
You should only focus on reaching early retirement
You don't have to become a product of your environment

[Verse 4: Knox Hill]
Racism facin' the nation, wages, they pay for the slavery
Paper is chains so we're chasin' labor for change in our nature
Trainers are traitors that are made in basements full of wages
And places that are basic daycares for children on acres owned by dictators
But ayy, see the wave (Hi), long as the Nike's lookin' fresh
The truth is swooshed, does anybody check? (Hmm)
That's why I rap outside the box (Yeah)
Till the day that I'm wrapped inside the box (Ah) in a private plot
Suicidal thoughts try to find their mark, in the dark of the night, these bars are light
These scars are the right, fuck a heart, fuck a like, no filter, my brain flip forward
Give you all these grams of the buzz that can't be bustlin', I never gave a fuck
Why would I ever give a thought?
And all you rappers blamin' the beat? You stay defeated (True)
Just pass me the mic, I'll jack these sons, you can't beat it (Uh)
You can't come at me, that con dome will be bleedin', throw your shade, son, till you get heated
But yo, Samad, pass the rock, motherfucker
Who's at the door? It's Knox, motherfucker
I'll leave you in that hill, don't you plot, motherfucker
Don't fake with the ball, take your shot, motherfucker
[Interlude 2: Knox Hill, KING BLITZ]
I'm out
King shit

[Verse 5: KING BLITZ]
Look, hol' up, this here is major (Ah)
Cookin' up with my delivery, I should probably cater, but I'm not a waiter
But I'm bringin' shit to the table like solvin' equations
And if you ain't addin' up, know I'm carryin' one
Don't make me demonstrate it, I'm ill, so I illustrate the statement (Ah)
Understand what I feel like if you playin' the role, I'm not partakin' or participatin'
Flow on a hyperbolic chamber
Every minute I'm a day of trainin' is way up on me then pain
Let me get to the eyes and I'm in rhymin', take a look up at the past man, I've been grindin'
And I got up in this shit, no, I started the bottom of the bitch, with the flow mesmerizing
And wrecked your job and you tell me, ""I could go braggadocious or conscious""
Don't want no nobody get up in the middle of the battle
We be livin' in these cultural problems, I'm hella mad
They react to black like we predators (Yeah)
They make our homes the scene of the crime then hold us for evidence (Wack)
What it's like to be American? Daily prejudice, regimens
Pointin' they arrogance down the barrel they got us starin' in (Facts)
Resident, though it's evident, it's hard to live in this hell knowin' you heaven-sent (Yeah)
Just expressive shit, really compressin' it
Needs to aim towards that progressive shift, they ain't addressin' it
Computer thugs really gettin' capped, and we ain't pressin' shift (For real)
Look, told you I'ma keep climbin' over your noodle
Go for the top with this rhymin', no beef on my shit
King shit only, I promise, kingdom, we climbin'

[Interlude 3: KING BLITZ]
Read in between the lines, nigga
King

[Verse 6: DuaneTV]
Anybody want smoke, they gettin' flexed on
Niggas out here thinkin' they bad 'cause they chest drawn
Everybody's sayin', ""You simple, I ain't impressed, dawg""
Well, I don't really care about punchlines, I ain't attend prom
Only mobbin' for my kinfolk, drama never been known (Nope)
Pimpin' like Obama in a pinto
Anyone got problems, nigga, get low to click close
Unless there's no pressure, we throwin' logic out the window
Now you want gun bars, most do them wrong
'Cause dudes mad lost, like, ""Let me go and shoot at y'all""
""I got a gun so big it's like a blue RAV4""
Well, my nine's in the side pocket, nigga, my pool game's strong
Fuck everybody after me, I ain't givin' up
Nigga, I came up with nobody, so I ain't get no love
I'll be solo till I die, nigga, I'ma live it up
So if you feelin' there's an issue, homie, I don't give a fuck (Uh)

[Verse 7: 100 Kufis]
Bar heavy, I was forced to get a liquor license
They've been afraid 'cause they really know I've been the nicest Outright, I will out-write all you awful writers
Pen game tight, shit, I might got arthritis (Uh)
If I don't like you, I don't like you, ain't no sneak dissin'
Knock you out your shoes, you'll wake up and find your sneaks missin'
This is how we handle the beef, we eat different
See the heat, toss that shit back like I'm flee flickin'
I'm spittin' heat, you gotta see that shit with heat vision
I keep switichin' up the flow, they gettin' seasickness
My bread good like them Red Lobster cheese biscuits
If you know like I know, them shits is delicious
We don't rap alike, this a different appetite
You dudes fruity, you remind me of an apple slice
The way I run tracks, it's a fact I might have passed you twice
You ain't a rapper, you a preacher–pass the mic
If you was half as nice, you will understand I got the juice
I just poured my soul in it like a glass of ice
Any rapper go against Kufi is a sacrifice
Two things I never give is a bad verse or bad advice
Before you gamble with your life, you better pass the dice
Before you ask to see my demons, better ask for Christ
I caught that lil' nigga slippin' at the traffic light
Blow! Something 'bout to go down, I'm glad it's night

[Verse 8: Gatsb7]
I heard Gats' in every verse, yo, I guess I've been summoned
So sub me in, I'm starvin', ain't no fuckin' ounce in my stomach
I've been counted out for years, now I'm 'bout to see summits
And I ain't ever begged for shit, ain't no colostomy, run it
Look, so many screamin' for change, but they never feed the meter
Artists get a morsel then deviate with a new demeanor
Even when they preach in remedial forward matters
When the benji's comin' in, they hit buttons and movin' backwards, ain't no dilo
It's about the bottom line, homie, this a free throw
Haters better step aside when I get in beast mode
Say you run the game, well, I'm really 'bout to repo
Snitches gettin' stitches, bitch, I never roll with Lilo
So I'm silently about it
I got the heart of a lion, and never back from the challenge
I lay low until you tell me I can't
I never needed your approval, I just needed a chance, it's Gats

[Verse 9: Sage]
You feel it creepin', the ill-i-ness be–
Ginin' to seep in, venom I release when I'm drillin' a beat
Chill with the Reaper, but still, it is me that is fillin' his dreams
You gonna be ready for bed, Freddy, when fake Kruegers get killed in their sleep?
Real when I speak, 'cause when I spit it's a movie, and it's my duty
To be flushed with the kind of crap that the rap game lacks when the shiznit isn't movin'
'Cause this to me what a list is to a 3D being that exists in 2D
Truly moving on a different level than everyone, they never want to listen to me
Snoop D-O double G, ooh-wee, what a nightmare, I want to smoke you weeds
You're sketchy, so to illustrate how I score on you the second you touchdown, I Drew Breeze
What's foul is to be playing like a chicken little, it'll bust out a two-piece
And in the cold and going to take shots on a line, when the only way to know how is to freeze
Who needs 'em a sockin'? I'm takin' off what I'm walkin' in and put a rock in it, they can all get it
Not dissin' if you're not with it, but I'm not finna bomb when I'm goin' off in it, off in it
Though too often it can all get twisted and all that
When this isn't dissin' at all, man, it's just what you'd call rap

[Verse 10: Murkemz]
They idolizin' the sire 'cause I'm providin' the wires
To blow this motherfucker off the hinge and stop the entire production
Make 'em say ""Fuck you,"" run home while sobbin' and cryin'
Hyenas laughin', they spotted, they meet the dominant lion
I tried to vibe with the cypher, Samad was droppin' the fire
A couple niggas was cool, some guys was awkward and tired
These substitute teacher lookin' niggas talkin' 'bout rhymin'
I leave these pussies for dead, then stick a fork in they hymen
Let the mac unload, crack his skull, quit the bag of [?]
Chattin' code, packin' .4s so we don't crack and fold
Trap a load, servin' motherfuckers like mac and rol'
And bangin' on 'em with the hammer, like whack-a-mole
Hol' up, let me chill, I'm hearin' they heart pumpin'
Thought they was big dogs, you puppies is far from it
And I feel like a track referee, so start stuntin'
On your mark, get set, when I shoot, they start runnin'

[Interlude 4: Grizzy Hendrix]
Y'all motherfuckers know what time it is
It's the Worldwide Cypher Takeover
And we 'bout to wrap it up like this
I go by the name of God Grizzy, let's go

[Verse 11: Grizzy Hendrix]
What makes you think you the hottest? You too broke, don't wanna pay homage
With that logic, you should just go retire 'cause no one's coppin', please
Unless it's Carl Winslow rappin', don't get mad I'm blockin'
Get mad at these rappers droppin' all that traction
I think Oscar De La Hoya ain't no boxin' me in with that silly nonsense
Gotta get rich before I die, I need more commas and more dollars
For these bills, I got O'Reilly, never hottest, Samad was poppin'
Not no lip gloss or Lil Mama, I'ma shoot your ass a follow
After I body your beat and I ain't have to use the llama (Achoo)
Damn bro, you good?
Excuse me, I've been off this shit quite often when I'm off the meds like Marshall
Flow is out of this world like martians, we've been marchin', Malcom, Martin
Still ain't killers with no problem, now y'all killers with no conscience
Y'all talk knowledge then talk violence, is it Huey or y'all Riley?
Wrote this rhyme all in my boxers, I feel like Muhammad Ali
In an airplane with no pilot, goin' kamikaze
With Em and Bin Laden in the cockpit, so come and suck this cock, bitch
ASAP, it's rocky
Y'all ain't packin' peace unless you rap like geeks, it's Ghandi
I know we all got two sides, but damn, somebody lyin'
All these knowledge catchin' bodies but nobody dyin'
Stop it, some body gotta be lyin' somewhere where no one can find them
But I guess I love fake gun bars, this that shit y'all want, dawgs?
Snoopin' through y'all profiles and all I see some good guys, like that dog
That tough talk, make one call and they gone, no mumble rap too, fuck off
I know these niggas don't want war, so what the fuck would I run for?
No treadin' mills on this song
These bars goin' over your head, you monkeys get swung on
A difference between lyricists and rappers with good penmanship
Pedophiles with a pen, y'all be on that kiddie shit

You can't talk on my name it got strings attached
Put BA on a drill he gon' shoot first
When he fire they gon' drop ain't no clickin' back
It's not safe you get put on a new shirt
Then it's back on the block, where my sinners at
Block, all my drillers at
Can't talk on the net we not into that
Talk on the net we gon' learn where you livin at
Gon' drive-thru, put a bitch on your body come find you
I can't play with my life she gon' die too
Anytime that you score we get times two and that's real shit

Slide here get shots like Henny
Can't play in the streets I done seen too many
All the stuff that I saw in these cold streets
All these moms losing sons over old beef
I done seen all my shooters get no sleep
Cause they slidin' for gang for the whole week
That's no cap, all the shots that we threw, never throw back
Turn your bro into pictures and throwbacks
We take one off the map tell 'em hold that
Remember nights on the floor in our old trap
Had no money to eat just a smoke pack
Where the opps? On my dick, they not on shit
On the court I'mma shoot like I'm Novaks

From me and Lauren
My name is Mac Lethal
But I'm gonna spit some paler and faster fucking lyrics

[Verse]
Oh hi! My name's Mac
Ecstasy, cocaine and crack
None of that I just smoke green
While Chinese people eat your cat
Roll by on a low-ride Huffy
Simpsons on and my beer is Duff see
Cuff rolled up to my calf
Cash out the ass cuz I wrote a couple raps for Puffy
Gotta be the one to bite the bullet I'm a sinner
But I bet I could have been a better man
I wanna be Zen but I go sipping on some medicine
Instead of meditating but I get it when I can
I don’t wanna wind up in the gutter with a bottle of malt liquor bitter cuz I never got a call
But who the fuck drinks malt liquor anymore?
Gimme vodka now and start sucking on my balls!
Motherfuckers wanna have another personal epiphany
I’m coming with a symphony eliminating
Everybody/anybody roll up like a cannibal
And bite em like a peanut butter apple in a minute
I’mma nibble on a pentagram and every single bitter lamb
Is getting so offended I don’t give a damn if anything
A mental plan is coming with a visually integrated
Entity and everybody’s gonna get the guillotine
I’m getting cinematic in a matter of a minute
Every milligram is devilish the Vatican will kill it dead
Gonna kill it 'til it’s dead
I’mma try to get em in the head, corn-fed
Midwestern whore bred
She looks so thick and juicy give it to me in the booty shorts
Then you gotta get up in the morn and get out!
Let's speed it up, big breath!
Never been a counterfeit of nothing I am just an elevated
Entity I’m coming and giving it back and then pumping
Dump on every instrument with increments of sentiments
And syllables I lunge I’m livid again I’m sticking it in their muffins
Make a couple million I’m hoping to I’m going to
So gimme another reason I should sit around and not experience
Benefits of getting down when all the drivel that they’re spitting
Is so hideous Godzilla fear the viciousness
Fear the viciousness

Gang gang, yelling gang gang
He gon' bust the chopper 'til the sun go down

Your bitch can suck on my dick
I wipe my cum on her lips, yea, I nut on that bitch, take my money and dip
Nigga, you play by the rules? You getting played for a fool
These niggas don't got your back, they don't love you like that and you think shit is cool

Bitch, I'm too real to be fucking with fakes
Im bout my minutes so cut to the chase
Play like you hard but I peep the charade
Kami the goat, I am a vet with my shit

Niggas know I'm the best, I was dancing the wrist
I was using these cuts that was tattered my skin
Run it up better than all of these folks
Bitch, I've been by my cheddar, I never stay broke
You was worried about likes on your Instagram post while I'm killing them up with the flows that I wrote

This is sad that I run the big dog in your clit
Put the diamond connect [?] amount to that bitch
I don't care 'bout possessions, more focused on this

Nothing Like It,rap,Beanie Sigel,2001,"[Intro]
I'm just a picture in a frame
I paint word pictures on the canvas of life
But I don't control the colors

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas, that shit scary
Sometimes I feel ahead of myself
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like ""Mack maintain, just grind, dog, better yourself""
So what I do? I take heed and pick up the pace
Can't explain it when I pick up my son and look at my face
I'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crackin' the pavement
There that voice go again ""Mack practice for greatness
Get paid for them immaculate statements""
Keep thinkin' of them hot lines, like a physic, I can't explain it
There's no pen when I write it, it's nothing like it

[Interlude]
Goddamn, what you want from me
What you want me to tell you huh?
Niggas thought that I would stutter huh, thought I was dumb
[Verse 2]
But I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just use my 9
And run wild with my boys, in the streets wild with these wars
Now the Qur'an and 48 laws, they polish my flaws
I'm movin' niggas like puppets with no strings attached
It's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mack
To look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin'
Pick you apart, like you niggas is transparent
(I see right through you niggas)
It's like Mack was born with advanced parents
I'm like the Sun shinin' at night
Imagine it dog, I know you wanna see me gradually fall
But I'm walkin' on air, breakin' every gravity law
It's nothin' like it, I swear
I spit words that skip through air
Let the words of a true thug hit your ear
It change colors like blue blood when it hit the air
It's nothin' like it

[Interlude]
Goddamn, shit, I can't explain it
Fuck y'all niggas

[Verse 3]
I changed my whole life in about 9 months, just like sperm in a womb
These young niggas never learn 'til they doomed
Try to tell them ""you can burn young punk without smellin' the fumes""
Make you shiver in the middle of June
Paint a picture so vivid, you can hang it up in your room
Shine bright like a prism, displayin' colors like Crayola
Think of the prisons with straight soldiers
Think about the niggas who fucked us and played over us
Think about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us
Just look at the the picture I'm paintin', it's so perfect
Open your eyes motherfuckers, you can't duck us
No survivors every soul shall suffer
I'm loadin' up revolvers every shell shall touch ya
I promise it's like jihad with these mags, I'ma bust ya

You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good

Talkin' about, ""What's the reasons?""

Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck

Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'

Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life

But she can rent it for a night, I don't mind, open wide

Wearing a white Birkin on a winter night

Anyone Out There,rap,Three 6 Mafia,1997,"[Verse: Lord Infamous]
One cold winter of many tales
Trails of blood left in frozen snow
A family slaughtered by a loved one, forgive scarecrow
I turned against God and everything that I cared for most
Police arrived, candle light, butcher knives, bloody bedposts
Found staked on the floor soaked in evidence of the root of violence
Only a teen, sent to spend my final life in an insane asylum
So a few years have passed—I'm an adult, I feel better now
But no matter, I tell them that I know they'll never let me out
I rot in this dread, my only world's the one in my head
I hate psychotherapists, I walk amongst walking dead
Everyday, yes, every single day, peepin' ways to escape
I gotta find a way out this place, it's a must, got to find a way
I'm pullin' hair up out my freakin' head, yo
They tranquilize a nigga put his ass in a choke
I wanna go psycho and kill these muthafuckin' folks
But in a padded room I know I'll never get up out this hole
I'm pacin' back and forth across this room, I gotta think of somethin', man I got to make a move
The day I killed my fuckin' family, in a week or two, I got to get up back out there, I wanna do it again fool
Gettin' cool with the old ass maintenance man
I told him ""If you help me out I'd put a lotta papes in your hand
I stashed a lotta dough in dirt before a nigga left it
If you help me out when I get out I'll give you half on that deal""
The old man with it, he grinnin', dat's straight
Look here, gramps, meet me at my door for the plan round 'bout eight
Check it, pops, you got to get a shovel and a pine box
Put me in the ground and dig me out once they talk to the cops
I'm gonna need a slight overdose of some motherfuckin' sleepin' pills
So while I'm waitin' in the dirt I won't breathe up the air in here
Sneak in the office, get the keys off of Dr. Malique
And while you doin' that I'll take the pills so I fall asleep
I started feelin' my awareness fadin' away
I could slightly hear all the dirt gettin' tossed onto the pine crate
I awoke and in my square waiting to be freed
But from the light I seen
Someone killed the maintenance man and threw him in with me

Story of my life, shit got wild chapters (Talk to ’em, cash)

[Chorus: Novel]
I’m so fried all day
On my grind always
Seen some foul, foul times
In this wild, wild life
And I ain't even trippin’, no
Since the world we live in is so cold
[Verse 2: T.I. & Novel]
Uh, been dealing and sinning from the beginning (Uh-huh)
Do whatever it take to make double profit percentage (Sheesh)
From the stoops and the benches to 'partment project with fences (Man)
Shit, we out here tryna get up out the trenches (Yup)
Elevate your comprehension, consolidate your vision (Oh)
If you were born to stand out, you wasn't meant to fit in (Uh-huh)
Remember car too clean to let a sucka sit in
This trap music shit mad, show you how it began
In every loss, you find a lesson, make a life investment (Woo)
But up to then, man, live a trap life, the shit these rap niggas act like
See I know how it feel to be behind the wheel (Woo)
With a trunk full of dope, blue lights in the mirror
License and insurance, give it to 'em, chill (Man)
You either play this shit perfect or you go to jail
From hopin’ I ain't got no warrants to Florence, Italy tourin'
Machine and the King, from Bankhead beyond (God damn)

[Chorus: Novel]
I'm so fried all day
On my grind always
Seen some foul, foul times
In this wild, wild life
And I ain't even trippin', no
Since the world we live in is so cold
And I ain't even trippin', no
Since the world we live in is so cold
[Verse 3: Novel]
Put it all on the line, these the signs of the times
Tryna keep peace of mind, guess I'm flawed by design
Pray to God to keep my sister alive
Down the Hennessy to keep the memories from fallin' out of my eyes
I seen some wild chapters (Uh-huh) dealt with grief through all stages (Uh)
Turnin' of the pages, deeper than Neil Gaiman
The world's in a hurry, it's hard to instill patience (Uh)
Yeah, we due for reparations and niggas is still waitin'
I sit in silence, lookin' for silver lining
I feel like Robin Williams, laughin' to keep from cryin'
You'd understand too, if you only stood where I am
On the hills of Jerusalem, in the city of Zion

[Chorus: Novel]
I'm so fried all day
On my grind always
Seen some foul, foul times
In this wild, wild life
And I ain't even trippin', no
Since the world we live in is so cold

He sold a milli, I’m vanilli
So it ain’t a thing to make it rain in hundred dollar bills
We throwing paper planes, riding through the N.O
Red Marc Jacob frames, we disappear like David Blaine
And pop up at the Lakers game
They playing the C’s with Paul Pierce throwing the B’s
That make the ref affiliated, every time he hit a three

Homicide's glorified on my side of town

But for first degree you get the death penalty
Or life without the posibility
Dat mean death in jail, unless you tell
And rat on somebody else
And put ya body on somebody else yea dat'll probaly help
But if you snitch just body yourself
Put the chrome to your own dome and hollow yourself

I kicked flows for you, kicked down doors for you
Even left all my motherfuckin' hoes for you
Niggas think Frankie pussy-whipped
Nigga, picture that, with a Kodak, Insta-mat-tac
We don't get down like that, lay my game down quite flat
""Sweetness, where you parked at?""
Petiteness, but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that—
I'm fuckin' with you
The bitch official, though; dick harder than a missile, yo
Try to hit it, if she trippin', disappearin' like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-O with the five in front
Probably a conniving stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'ma peel with her
Find the deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Televisions, Versace heaven, when I'm up in 'em
The shit she kicked—all that shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga trick ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressing me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playing 'gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112 CD blast, I was past
She came twice, I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, saying, ""I'm smoking on homegrown""
Then I heard a moan, ""Honey, I'm home!""
Yup, tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad, I know he won't like this
Now I'm, like, ""Bitch, you better talk to him
Before this fifth put a spark to him
Fuck around, shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him—arm, leg...""
She beggin' me to stop, but this cat gettin' closer
Gettin' hot like a toaster, I cock the toast, ugh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, ""Honey, bring me up somethin' to drink!""
He go back downstairs, more time to think
Her brain racing, she's telling me to stay patient
She don't know I'm cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will, though; I'm tryna chill, though
Even though situation looking kinda ill, yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch, ""Gimme your scarf, pillowcase, and rope""
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Played the cut, nigga coming off some Love Potion shit
Flash the heat on 'em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass, screaming, ""Don't blast, here's the stash!
A hundred cash! Just don't shoot my ass, please!""

Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the Five, call my niggas on the cell

Bat Cave Radio Freestyle,rap,Meek Mill,2008,"I tell em, I say
One yourself when 2 niggas run up with 3 gats
A four, five, six shots, seven like eight claps
Da nine milli throw ten shots where ya face at
And the MAC 11 tucked in where da 12 gauge at
When I was 13 had 14 grams of ajax
Turned 15 start spitting 16s of straight crack
By 17, 18th street where I played that
19 niggas on the corner with 20s and they strapped
Playin with my money like playin with my emotions
Floatin off that water like I'm layin in da ocean
Roastin, I make you disappear, hocus-pocus
We leave these suckas like they Jerry Rice, wide open
In da field to get real, ya block slow-motion
And the bills rollin in just like a coasta
Gotta catch a nigga sleepin late night, stick em with the toaster
Make him put it all in like he was playin poker
Cause I remember days, nights, I couldn't even think right
Niggas gettin murked out I'm clutchin on that thing tight
I wouldn't even blink like
Blink once, blink twice
Cause that'd get ya life snatched
Faster than a Tyson match
Pull up to the scene
So fresh, so clean
In a 7-4 pound, with the windows rolled down
Like 20 on my neck, feel like the king, no crown
I be Prada down enough and all my year be low down
Red horse, red stripes
Red porshe, red lights
Tell me stop cause I'm killin em
Got chains like a millions
Lames they not feelin em, but tell em keep hatin
Praying on my downfall, tell em keep waitin
I be here, I be there
Wear them rocks on rocawear
I'm so fly without no leer
Why would I lie? No I don't care
I ride that fire without no fear, keep that choppa on deck
If a hater run up on me hit him up with no rat
It's big business, big bills, and big choppas
Cherry red Challenger, lookin like a lobster
All blacks D's on it, hoes holla
Slidin through your area
Why is they comparin us?
Serious, numbers on my check look like a serial
And I still got the block jumpin, Shawn Marion
I said a hater disrespect me then I'm airin em
He don't dig me where I from we just bury em
We count money, fuck bitches, go super hard
Maybach, layed back, looking like a super star
Diamonds on my neck, shining on em like a shooting star
30 in the clip it's got me feeling like a shooting guard
Stop me, small but I'm cocky
2 40s give a sucka 80 like Shockey
Pull up in the hood 4 door Mazeradi
Jewels on flashy like a paparazzi
Copy, I be probably in the hills out in Cali
In the million dollar crib eatin on shrimp and brocolli
Watch me, Pilladels Flyer, no hockey
Tell your chick to google me, she can dot com me
She ain't gotta chase me, just tell her myspace me
And maybe she can find me, so I can get behind it
Heard I got a deal so now she joe me like sloppy
Got the goons on deck, they ride hard like Kowazakis
They ride hard, I said they ride hard
I say we be the freshest
Jury be VVSes
Kated by DTSes
Like Khalid shit we the best and
I tell em hoes I don't wanna talk, just leave a message
Automatic stash boxes so they can see the weapons
But I be DC reppin, Grand Hustle the muscle
No me don't love these girls, I just love when I fuck em
I just ah, no me don't love these girls, I just love when I fuck em
Let me keep it clean, holdup what I say?
I said, I said, said
I got money on my mind, change on my membrane
Insane, in the kitchen with it got the whip game
Similar to Gordon, throw it in the pyrex
Like can I get your order? Ounces to the quarter
Omelly pushed the rock, I pushed the haze power forward
20s have a niggas floatin like he in the water
Sure ya, we got bundles for a Goya
A bean my nigga, if you need I get it for ya
This sawyer on my hip, tinted in the rora
Bad lil chick with me, looking like Kimora
Lead that's me in the pocketbook to yora
Long pretty hair ass juicy and Coutura
20s, 50s, hundreds, nigga that's all up in my money grip
We chewin like it's double mint
That 40 got a double clip
Automatic magnum like a condom with a rubber grip
And these suckas step up out of line and we gon fuck em up
I hug that strip, on the block, with that Yao Ming
Those oh-yous put them on a higher plain like Al Green
Now I mean, ay ay, they hear when I talk
Got that white girl and that green lady like Fairmount park
And this nigga think he G, I bet he fear when I spark
Put some hot shit in his tea, he be layin out, chalk
Where he at? There he go
Pull up on that nigga slow
Got that ruga clip like rula shootin like a video
And we be ridin, ridin, slippin, slidin
All through the city with that semi right beside him
Ballin like Jimmy, and that nigga try and try him
We catch em when they slippin, homicide em
I said now they start and stop and frisk us, niggas gettin childish
But really they ain't stoppin shit, that's just gon get a cop in here
We're competent, common sense, cause niggas, they rock this shit
From where they forever hate,you'll never get a compliment
I'd rather do a 5 to 10, nigga fore I lose my life
Go out in a blaze of glory, squezing with my trigga tight
Young loke, and gun smoke, and done choke, and nigga
Raised by the rat's roaches, real youngen holdin coke
State they gave my man life, Feds they gave my man 10
Messin with this dirty game feel like I'm on a dead end
Like damn where my nigga Rick
Damn where my nigga Brick
As time flies I think about you, know you tired and sick of it
Then they said my nigga snitched, I could neva see that
Talkin that they got statements on him, hold let me read that
Believe that
Was gettin high off of life, about to relapse
Gud gang, aka them Ladder boys, we back
We back
I ain't playin

I said
I don't make it rain, I ain't rich
I ain't got a milli, I ain't trynna chase a bitch
Yeah I got signed, but I ain't got them bricks
And I still step up in the club feelin like I'm Mitt
We got Squally in the building, he be there strapped
Omelly outside and he let out with the Mac
Me I'm in the crowd, just chillin fallin back
Peepin out the scene, I see a hater I react
Like you don't want no problems
We come with them choppas
They call us the Ladder Boys cause we get it poppin
We don't do no robbin, all we do is grind
Hustle from the muscle nigga, save up every dime
Everybody know I'm bout to blow like a bomb, boom
Pull up in the '96 Impala, vroom
Hammers in the stash box dirty, broom
The holster in the passenger, gansta, goon
Yeah I do my thang
Uh, I said, I said
Yeah I be on some shit, yeah I do my thang

I ain't gon give em that, Imma let Raw give em that man
I do my thang man, shout out to my boy Oskee
My boy Oskee, my boy Oskee
Hold on, hold up
I said, they gave my nigga 20 years, man that wasn't even right
Got him in the Hell hole, livin at the speed of light
Prayin that the time fly by so he can see the light
See his kids meet a wife, all over a key of white
But why you think they take that time from you, cause you need it right?
And you can't get it back, so how they givin people life?
Like you gon live again, grow up be a kid again
That's why I never waste time, I cherish every minute in
Pray that God faithful though
Man half that shit I make, I blow
I don't even take it slow
Cause any given day could go
And I could see my death date, feel my last breath take
That's why I go and get it now
I be like shit wait
Die young, and the bag don't even last that
Where the young niggas 16 and over die fast at
I was made there, raised there but moved past that
Livin at the speed of light, it looked like a flash back
I don got money, went broke then got the cash back
Had it I was cool though, lost it I got laughed at
That's why I never ever cherish nothin I can have back
Thankful for my life though, I wish I could stash that
Shit I'm just livin at the speed of light
Ballin hard to see the light
Be here today, to cease tonight
I just hope when God come arrest me that he read my rights, read my wrongs, ah

Rest in peace to Shotty too man.  Rest in peace all my boys man
Free the whole State Road.  Man, when you get out here man, all my boys that's booked, man when you get out here do

Perfect Couple,rap,Fozzey & VanC,2012,"[Verse 1]
They were the perfect couple, they'd always lock lips
He gave her his heart, he said don't drop this
She looked him in the eye, and said I promise you
I'll  replace it with mine and it's not gonna move
He'd always ditch his friends, he put their love first
But as he found out, that's when love hurts
She wasn't faithful, always out creepin' round
And she was never really there whenever he'd be down
But he never caught on, he was caught up
Cause growin' up, he was never really taught love
His old man always did his mum the wrong way
And whenever they'd fight he'd let a song play
So he told himself ""fuck it I'll be different""
But little did he know by doin' that, he'd be distant
Cause his girl was always goin' out and gettin' high
But he loved her too much that he let it slide
He didn't understand why she'd always make it hard
But he never spoke up, so they could make it last
And over time you could see it start to take a toll
It's like she got a kick out of tryna break his soul
But still he soldiered on, puttin' on that brave face
Until the night he saw her gettin' with his best mate
His stomach dropped as his chest started cavin' in
She gave his mate the same looks that she gave to him
He didn't say a word he just turned around
Cause every bridge they'd ever built, she just burnt 'em down
He sent a subtle text, not knowing what's coming next
All he thought about was tying that rope 'round his neck
He sat in his room, talkin' to his walls like
""No-one will miss me, I'm sure that they'll be alright
I mean look at me, I can't even find hope""
Just before he stepped off and tied the rope
An hour passes, nobody knows that he's gone
He's tensed up, all white with a note in his palm
His girlfriend walks in and drops to the floor
But the note in his hand can not be ignored
Tears runnin' down her face and her make up
The first three words she read were ""I hate love
I saw everything, I saw the look in your eye
But in a way it's alright cause we're born to die
Tell mum and dad that I'm sorry that it came to this
But I can't go on because I hate this shit
I hate the way you can do everything you please
And deep down you know I gave you everything you need
All the memories we made start to fade to black
And I know just like you I can't take this back
I also wrote you a song it's in your tape deck
And when we fucked I just wished it was safe sex
Cause I saw the positive on the stick you hid
But for all I know, the kid could be his
So don't try and say I'm the one that fucked up
And I know your hearts breaking and it sucks huh
This is it though I'm runnin' out of time to write
But I'm goin' cause I felt like the time was right
And you should know that my very last thought was you
And there's pictures on my bed that I was sortin' through
I just wish when it came to us you would try
But this is it baby, goodbye""",98387,9162
Otherside Remix,rap,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,2010,"[Hook: Fences]
Oh girl, this boat is sinking
There's no sea left for me
And how the sky gets heavy
When you are underneath it
Oh I want to sail away from here
And God, he came down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
And said nothing

[Verse 1]
He rolled up, asked him what he was sipping on
He said lean, you want to hit it, dawg?
That's the same stuff Weezy's sipping huh
And tons of other rappers that be spitting hard
Yup, yup he had five a bone
When he passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter pink, heard it in a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip, sitting in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimping as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hot box, let the bass bump
Take it to the face, gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddam, he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat, just so healing
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up, cold sweat, scratching, itching
Trying to escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it
Didn't even think he had a problem
Though he couldn't sleep without getting nauseous
Room spinning
Thinking he might of sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed shut
Sat back in the chair clutching that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name, shook him but he never got up
He never got up, he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinking that it won't be us
It won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us
Nah, it won't be us

[Hook: Fences]
Oh girl, this boat is sinking
There's no sea left for me
And how the sky gets heavy
When you are underneath it
Oh I want to sail away from here
And God, he came down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
And said nothing

[Verse 2]
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed, ash in a tin
Pack being pushed, harassed by the Feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talking about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise, you know the drill
Trapped in a box, declining record sales
Follow the formula: violence, drugs, and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pain
Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant
Despite how Lil Wayne lives
It's not conducive to being creative
And I know cause he's my favorite
And I know cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication
But he's an alien
I'd sip that shit
Pass out or play PlayStation
Months later I'm in the same place
No music made, feeling like a failure
And trust me it's not dope to be twenty-five
And move back to your parent's basement
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And ""Weed's not a drug,"" that's denial
Groundhog Day, life repeat each time
I've seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them
We used to chief dimes
I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheating and lying
Friendship cease, no peace in the mind
Stealing and taking anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealer's supplying
That rush, that drug, that dope
Those pills, that crumb, that roach
Thinking I would never do that, not that drug
And growing up nobody ever does
Until you're stuck
Looking in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become
Swore I was going to be someone
And growing up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up, keep me up

These H-Town boys like to swang and bang

(Slim Thug)
Now welcome to the City of Game, piece and chains that swang
Pop trunk and bang as I grip wood grain
I'm bout that down-south city, where they show no pity
Candy paint be lookin' pretty, makin' haters feel shitty
See I'mma long star balla, and a chop shop crawler
18-year-old shot callah, and a droptop crawler
I'm no less than the best, yes I must confess
And hell that Cess in my chest to relive off stress
Freshly pressed in my Guess, I got that baguettes on my chest
It's 3rd coast in do' and the rest must wreck
Went from'a BMX to a GS Lex, born and raised in Houston Tex
Where we don't bar no plex

Rocks in my wrist, gat close to hip
Just in case a hater out there gets me pissed

Like C-Note I'm tryin' to have diamonds in my grill
And I'm breakin' boys off with my freestyle skills
Givin' them something they can feel, man just chill
Man what the deal with the syrup and the pill
In the lac' wit cat with 18's in da trunk
Da Alpine thump, it's SCREW that we bump
TV in steering wheel, with fifth wheel in the back
Went to town I keep it hot with five plates up in da dash
Wearin' white socks and dem black Nike sandals
We down-south nigga's this something yall can't handle
Ride man I'm drippin' so much up on da freeway
Down-south baby switchin' lanes up on da freeway

They're gettin Slaughta'd!
Death to the wack MC's

Here we go, with the jeep (ass niguh) (Welcome to the Slaughtahouse!)
Never hear me talking ""I could kill a man!!""
Started making records but I'm still a fan
I'll take you down, I break your crown
I make you frown, I wake the town
Tick, check it out, tock, I rock your whole block
Got the funk dialect in stock
With the boom, bashin, bass drum is smashin
And crashin your bedroom walls, and monster mashin
Dashin, man with the kick, that be flying

To sound ill, you couldn't find their brains with a drill
Check it...

(Welcome to the Slaughtahouse!)
Welcome to my Slaughtahouse, it's like a playpen
Welcome to my Slaughtahouse, there's no escapin

Are sharp like axes, and suckas get the chills
Drum is the cash, like the rash you'll be itchin
For the green and, everybody's talking like they're mean and
Crazy, oh baby, you're ready, for this yo
Make me, a poster, holdin, a pistol
Then I can be the (man)
I can be the (man)
'Cause they see me with the gun in my hand
I, am not, down with the standard
The man did, not do, what every other man did
Candid, just like the man Allen Funts
And there's nothing worse than, a rapper when he fronts
So throw your hands up in the air
If you really don't care
About the next man's life, you get the chair
In the Slaughtahouse
""The price a rapper must pay""

Chickens in the sink
Crack on the stove
Triple beam for the weight
Cut the middle man tryna get eight white bitches
Snorting off the plate coke from Colombia
Riding 'round in the Benz looking like a trapstar
Flipping raw day and night
Tryna get my money right naw I ain't living right
Fucking bitches all night kick 'em out the next day
Everyday is pay day
Hit me with a half bring it back in two days
Living in Cali by the ocean
Condo got em open
Long dick stroke em
I send 'em to the husband he over there fussing
I'm over here fucking no loving
Puffing on heavenly rockstar 70's
Slim pants ripped jeans Jeremy Scott wings
Fucking heavily counting up cream
Rolling on beans disobedient with trees
Tatted from neck to ear bitches they want to stare
Macking with hoes as I pose
Hand in my draws, Henny out my pores
As I pour hit the blunt too much you on the dash as I pass

Surrounded by white bitches
Slipping off wedding rings

Got these niggas backs
Meet me by the border ounce to a key
Flying over seas
Korean imported extorted these niggas
Smoking out the bong
Lighting up the spliff Basel on my wrist
Bought me a six pop the willy on that bitch
She snorting off my dick put her on the strip
Flipping my bread triple my spread nigga bring it back
Triple my racks bricks in my backpack

I’m running from jail, sales and caught
More way trips, bare skrt skrt skrt
Smoking dope with bro

He got wacked, he got chinged
So how these punks gon talk about scores
Niggas chat 'til the papers write on papers
Proceeding statements
I was with J, more way trips
And he got his face in the papers
More time I got mind on the papers
Chasing Elizabeth’s faces
They had me on trial for knifings and violence
But I thank Allah for busting those cases

(Huh)
(Ooh)

[Verse 1]
I miss the days when no one even knew my name
Now everywhere I go I wear a hat to hide my face
I got weapons hidden inside every room in my place
Now I have to keep a pistol on me always just in case
This is a nightmare, never expected the fame
To be something I would wrestle with and fight to embrace
Sometimes I feel like the love I gеt's outweighed by the hatе
I hid the tears, but I can't hide from the pain
I'm workin' 20-hour days, can't even lie to y'all, I'm burnt out
I sleep on my weight bench, tryna find the strength to work out
Should be happy I'm successful, I just went and bought my first house
Thought money would help cure my depression, but it's worse, how?
Tired of it, lucky I don't have a manager 'cause I'd be firin' him
Tired of talkin' to other artists
Who just wanna tell me I'm inspirin' them
Parents keep tellin' me they have a kid
And they're thankful the child is admirin' me
Great, you wanna know how I feel?
I might kill myself before retiring
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in the clouds
I can't reach the ground
They're comin' in crowds
Blew me up like a balloon and let me-

[Chorus]
Go
Watch me float away while I scream ""no""
Every time I get close, they pull out their phones
Like, ""Maybe this time we can see him explode""
Blew me up like a balloon and let me go
They all throwin' rocks 'cause they're tryna poke holes
They wanna see me pop, they don't wanna see me blow
They're the reason that I'm gone, they don't wanna see me glow
Blew me up like a balloon and left me

[Verse 2]
I miss the times when I could go outside
I didn't have to watch my back out of the corner of my eye
I didn't have to fake a smile and pose for pictures all the time
Can't even lie, I miss when time was really mine
Now I just belong to everybody else but me
These panic attacks are makin' it awful hard to breathe
Built a vocal booth inside the crib and stopped makin' beats
Don't even rap, I stand inside of it and scream
Like this is not what I expected, I worked my hands to the bone
And my anxiety is triggered by the apps on my phone
I tried deleting them so the Internet would leave me alone
But the lack of attention made me feel worse than before
I'm sick of it all, the internet watchin' me trip when I fall
Embarrassed that everyone witnesses all
My illnesses in real-time, man, I'm addicted to y'all
Rappers on Twitter don't get me involved
I'm posing for photos with fans in the mall
I'm dying inside, pretending I'm strong
I'm not a celebrity, I am just Tom
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in the clouds (Huhuhuhuhuh)
I can't reach the ground (Huh)
They're comin' in crowds (Fuck)

Watch me float away while I scream ""no""

Like, ""Maybe this time we can see him explode""

I miss the years when every Friday wasn't spent with my therapist
Then I realized I hated fame and accepted that I'm scared of it
I got Ativan, Cipralex, Xanax and Seraquel
In a Tupperware container, I don't touch, I just stare at 'em
Breathin' exercises supposed to help me to cope
But nothin' works quite as good as a bottle of jack and a smoke
I try to focus on my breath but it gets stuck in my throat
This never happened back when I was young and happy and broke
I never thought I'd be the rapper all these rappers try to be
Posting twenty times a day, now I don't have no privacy
Meeting with these major labels, CEOs with giant teams
If y'all wanna do business, why are y'all tryna lie to me?
I'm bored of the fame
Every time it feels fresh again I'm gettin' more of the same
Interviewers think they know who I am
They made up their mind before I explain
Well, because you asked so nice, I guess I'll tell
Ain't been feelin' too hot lately, Jim, is there anything else? Great
'Cause lately every day I feel like I'm livin' in hell
I'm glad the music helps you, but I might really kill myself
When this magazine gets printed, can you send one to my house?
I'd like to own a tiny piece of me like everybody else
[Chorus]
Go
Watch me float away while I scream ""no""
Every time I get close, they pull out their phones
Like, ""Maybe this time we can see him explode""
Blew me up like a balloon and let me go

Stand at the stove, whip a slab, that's a cookie slab
Police tried to get me for a gang, I had an alibi
Nah, fuck niggas you a lie
Rel hit a jug Willie Mac found a nine
Forreal we were hot boys
Put the gun up in your mouth just like a Altoids
Chopper start snappin', gotta be a damn poet

Trap on the block whether rain, sleet, or snow
Young nigga tryna make a dope deal
They askin' me questions like Dr. Phil
Got excited when I seen a half a mil'
I was prayin' just to get a record deal
Now we independent, worth a couple M's
Came a long way from bustin' out sticks and stems

Sex Rap,rap,Red Hot Chili Peppers,1985,"[Verse 1]
Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're going to get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumping that driving bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine, sucking on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out
Make her moan, make her groan and make her shout
Push it all in and pull it all out
Pump  that labia 'till it pouts

Open your legs to the sensual sound
Let the booty bustin' beat pound your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hump the ground
As you're droppin' to your knees and I come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down

[Verse 3]
Our lustful notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady loving a viable stud
Causing what is known as a juicy wet pud
Getting it getting it getting it good

Wow, in my head, as a jellified hum
I take to rubbing her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue

Well I like to make her cum

Acting like you're the best, bluffing
Stop gossiping around and just assault them with the facts
Assault them with the fa-fa-facts
Acting like a know-it-all, pretending you're not the one
Stop doing this and that and just assault them with the fa-fa-facts
Assault them with the fa-fa-facts

[Verse 1: PSY]
Yeah, the shit I poop is thick
Don't be jealous, just kneel down
Back in 2001, I was a bizarre singer
But now I've made a place for myself in the industry
I've been to the slammers and back
I've lived in the barracks for a while
I've stuck a flag in the Billboard
I've lied through my teeth at Oxford

[Verse 2: PSY]
For all this weight and my visuals
You could say that I've eaten enough
Am I out of the ordinary?
In this Confucian country, I've lived to 41
You could say that I've aged well enough
Ears of rice bow deeply as they ripen
But we aren't ears of rice, so keep your head up
Humility is a virtue? Yeah, right
Become a fan of me - obsess over me
[Verse 3: PSY]
My shocking physical stamina
I never get tired, it's a family trait
My endless refills of encores are my charm
My concerts are my moneymakers
All those motherfuckers calling me a ""one-hit wonder""
You've dried out to the core, you motherfuckers
Drink water, drink water
Pull out your dick and eat it, eat it

[Verse 4: PSY]
You ask, ""PSY? PSY of what century?""
PSY of today, you motherfucker
You supported me when I became a world star
Then talked shit about me, that I've lost my touch
From my debut song, ""Bird""
To this song right now
I've worked my ass off doing my own thing
And I've come this far

[Verse 5: G-Dragon]
Assault them with the facts and keep it coming
Bitch you don't know can't fuck with me
Even dogs and cows are saying ""swag"" now
I don't know about that, they're all fucking trash
Babies who reek of breast milk who think they've tasted success
And who think they're the shit, listen up:
All of a sudden, it feels like the world is yours, right?
But Jaesang-ie hyung's right in front of you, so kneel down

[Verse 6: G-Dragon]
Crawl away, now relax
Attention (aye), keep a straight face (pew pew)
Are my words ever wrong? (swerve)
People say I'm wrong just because of my pronunciation
I'm the celebrity of your celebrities, the one and only
I'm everyone's celebrity
No pain no pain no gain no-

[Bridge: G-Dragon (PSY)]
Crawl away (with the time)
Now relax (that you talk shit about others)

Yo
I ain't gonna front
It's been a rough couple months
Ex ladies having babies, business just been fucking up
Plus I been feeling like my tongue is stuck
Puffin' blunts to feel something other than nothing, numb
This bubble keeps 'em on the outside
But let’s them in enough to think there’s never any downtime
The town's size muffles the outcries about white lies that the side of my mouth hides
Yeah, I said I hide behind a mask
Try to find the lighter side of writing 'bout the past
Lookin' at the stars, lying on the grass
And cooking up them bars when I'm high enough to gas
I fall for girls that's taken
Swooping relations on the verge of breaking
Wonder if my turns worth the wait
When the search don't work and the flirts is vacant

It's a piece of paper that you got paying for school
Look at your feet and wonder who made your shoes
The feeling in your tummy knowing money made the moves

And thinking that ya ma dukes ashamed of you
Knowing that someone you trusted just been playing you
But nah, this ain't the blues - Na-uh, it ain't the blues
[Verse 2]
Nah, it's something much deeper
You wanna fall in love but know lust is just cheaper
Cut it up, bust a nut and just leave her
You fuckin' up, know you're running from keepers
I spend a lot of time in my cave now, worried that the drum breaks might lead to break downs
Venting? on a song that's never ending
Lifting up the pen and pretending, I'm picking up the pace now
But what's the point of runnin' faster - if you're only runnin' laps
You're so concerned about staying on the track you forget the finish line's the starting point you're coming back to
So now I keep it how the crow flies
Cause road signs never point to gold mines
And closed eyes don't enjoy the whole ride
Bundle for a cold night, buckle up and hold tight

Yo
Money comes and goes
But If it goes before it comes should you know your role, own your soul or go and load your gun
Never yell, but never hold your tongue
And never listen to the tall tales them other soldiers spun
The truth has a few different shades
Believablilty belongs to who's getting paid
I didn't know the rules, I was new to the game
'til you snapped your foul fingers and the crew shifted ways
Man, I was a fool to the end when
I understood you embodied rule number seven
I did the work - you took the credit
You played the game smarter man that's cool; I accept it
But don't be out smearing my name while
You step on people'ss backs to get yourself paid pal

Real nigga shit, niggas not how they seem like
Real nigga shit, I'm goin' up and niggas seem tight
Nowadays I walk around, I feel like I got three eyes
Remember seein' through the whole scene, I was knee-high
You get what you want and I get what I want
B for the bitches, same bitches I put my niggas on
I ain't had no plan B, me and A had to get along
I was sixteen, everyone in the room sippin' strong
But you know I'm a leader, my mentality really strong
If you ever diss me, then nigga, you know you really wrong
Remember bitches dubbed me, now all these bitches, they sing my songs
I done had some feelings, I took 'em all to the studio
I done seen some thotties, I took ’em all to my video
If I let you use your phone, shawty better not take no videos
I don’t give a fuck if your friends heard me all up on the radio
Yeah, on the radio, that's the way to go
Gotta be yourself, lil’ nigga, that's the way to grow
They gon' try put you down but you got stay afloat
And sometimes got to put your foot down and start sayin' no
And sometimes got to isolate and just start settin’ goals
[Chorus]
Every insecurity, they do not mean shit to me
Because it is you I adore
And baby girl, I hope you come in history, can't let these niggas get to me
I'd regret if you, I lost
Every memory is searchin' for a long time
Every thing was in my face and I was so blind
I told myself ""I cannot just be one of those guys""
I just need some faith, so I'm talkin' to the most high
Every insecurity, they do not mean shit to me
Because it is you I adore
And baby girl, I hope you come in history, can't let these niggas get to me
I'd regret if you, I lost
Every memory is searchin' for a long time
Every thing was in my face and I was so blind
I told myself ""I cannot just be one of those guys""
I just need some faith, so I'm talkin' to the most high

Exhibit 6,rap,Lil B,2011,"[Intro - Lil B]
This is my Exhibit 6
Shouts out to Jay Electronica
Pray for me

[Verse - Lil B]
I was plotting on the game
On the Killa shit, illa shit
But I lost my brain - this is pain
On the track. Niggas heavy off the caine
I don't know what time it is
And I did forgot my name, but
A nigga went through things that
Make you go insane. Product of the hood
I was tripping off the chains
Knowing it's the chains
That destroy these nigga's brains
America done lied, they serving false game
You gotta be real to even feel the same
I swear to God I'm so real, nigga
Like David Blaine
This is my Exhibit C
This is God right beside me
Wise man mourn more for the fools
Than the wise man. Pre-conceived notions
Please move beside them
I'm living off instinct
The honor in my conscience
The fire in my soul: I'm not a rap artist
This is spoken word. You niggas have nerve
To have your doubts on what is superb
Don't mistake knowledge for wisdom
The first is a living, the other is a gift, son
Learn off the (shh), and get your distance
Made myself a man: I ain't even need assistance
My heart is wiser than my mindset
Don't let your mind fade
I ain't even drop the dime yet: listen
I ain't even drop the dime yet
Can't sleep at night
The pain got me open
The pain got me angry
The pain got me smoking
Flat on my back it was the courage that was potent
Now I'm giving blessings
I won't take suggestions
Haters try to down me
But this is my progression
Me up in the studio is when you see perfection
Achievement connected with the actions
Last time I failed
Is when I fell in love with distractions
Personal development, springboard excellence
Be anything just not nor the Devil-ish
But let me..dont let the mind slip, nigga
Let the pedal slip. Let the Mack-11 spit
Intensity of purpose: that's how I define a genius
To reach a great spot you gotta dip
Talking about death not deaf
Raising every time we fall
Niggas ask who the best
Whoever that they think
Based over here'll hustle hard
I won't blink. Obstacles are scary
Feeling like you're cursed, do it for the people
Most of it is just work
This Exhibit 6, please drop the 7
I heard some evil numbers, but I won't repeat em
I'm human like you, I want the knowledge like you
But don't trip: I stay on paper like glue

Fast Rap Battle,rap,Boyinaband,2013,"[Nonelikejoshua]
Are you ready to battle?

[Boyinaband]
Yes

[Joshua]
Here we go:

[Verse 1: Boyinaband]
Oh hai, you're that guy
The one that I gotta bring down in a fight
Built up high like I'm battle with a skyscraper - oh wait-
Are you like five foot five?
Find it difficult to follow everything I just said?
Struggling to keep up with your iddy biddy legs
I guess that's the case and my faster pace will outlast and make you exasperated
You're the one stuck hesitating
While I keep accelerating
The friction of my lips is so hot that anything you spit will evaporate and
I'm spitting with a similar rhythm as a machine gun
If you think of bringing a white flag you'll need one
I have the speed of a photon try to keep up
But you can't cause you can't ""c"" me, son!
[Verse 1: Nonelikejoshua]
Well dad
I am that guy so fly so quick
2 guys 1 mic, but you're vomiting
I spit hot fiya, mute spittah
I rap so fast, I can hear you quiver
Bring it back into the matter of the fact that I can rap with a gat
While you chatter with a lack of the pattern that I would rather
Be traveling to the saturn rings and back
But you still haven't said a single thing in your rap
And actually - I'm 5 foot 9
When I rise to the sky like a rocketship
You'll be saying ""oh hai"" while you're walking in to
The back of the bus, so holla bitch
I'm monstrous
My flow is tight, while you're slobbering
You mumble and slur what no one's ever heard
And it's all absurd, so you'll be stickin to the beats and never stickin to the words

[Verse 2: Boyinaband]
Are you sane bud are you stable when you say you'll battle Usain Bolt
Stay all the way back with your banter, man
Or static'll attack you like a van der graaf
Harder better stronger faster
A lot of focus on that last word
Yeah you spit hot fire, can you figure out why?
Cause you're not a rapper
Bringin it with everything a million men
On the internet think is a brilliant method of
Proving I bettered a pathetic American like
""oh that British guy is better""
Better hair better height
Better style better rhymes
Better mention I made the beat too
I have time since I already beat you
[Verse 2: Nonelikejoshua]
While you're having a seat and sitting back and you're sippin on a cup of tea
I'll be bringing dat heat, like a bomb on your city with a blitzkrieg, literally
Don't ever think you're gonna be a better man to beat me in a battle and without a plan
To make it to another round cause I'm bout to pull out the nitro
Asian like Tokyo Drift, too fast and yet too furious
I'm curious, how you want to think about me when you're sleeping tight
Wish you want to be fast like the speed of light
Oh wait, you win, cause that's what your girl just said last night
And you know I don't care
What's slowing you down is your long ass hair
Anything that you spit is a miss not a hit
I'm the fastest
'Cause I'm accurate while your ass is whack as shiiiiiii",3557,96787
Float,rap,Aesop Rock,2000,"[Verse]
This fallen angel could stitch a wing with a shoestring;
The prime directive selects reflective aviation bathed in mood swing
I'm broke. I know a walking corpse who'd spit icicle dagger to slit throat
Quicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope (H-O-P-E)
I paint a portrait from my cell called life inside the tortoise shell
Tortured
Orbiting hell's orchard intrigued but not compelled
I smell a hint of charred child flesh sweeping through my quarters
Order one canteen of liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter
Now is you is the villain of my kabuki hologram
Cuz I hobble with hollow hands
Please pan the nozzle
We see intent to re-invent dream application with homage to ancients
But honor modern replacements circling now basics
I'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tipping the Petri dish (fresh)
Beached fish on the shores where the feast of wits eat the corpse
Divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible
That's a harp of a different color but the song remains identical
I am not a crook
I cook the wick at both ends
Just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope dance
Life
Sight beyond
Fire ant with a hunger pain gut be gone
Belong to something civil, saint, cuz this Rembrandt paints on
And it's a cold canvas lodged in the gut of Atlantis
Some present impressive lung, some truly learn what a death chant is
I alone personify mankind's collective sulk
As a result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp in bulk
Face it
Die
Place it on the shelf next to the portrait mommy gave you of the day it rained
But y'all posed by the slave ship anyway
Make it rain 'til the levy breaks
My fetus breeds as a combine of father time and his sweetest concubine, wine
And it saddens me like televised casualties
I'll be hung in the village square in exactly 5 minutes;
You don't want to miss it
As a token of my discontent regarding the equation
I'm officially closed for consultation

International players anthem,rap,PnB Rock,2016,"Aw yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Time to separate myself from all these clown niggas
You ain't in my circle than you can't be around niggas
You get no handshake you get a pound nigga
That's even if you get close enough to be around niggas
Cus we don't like new faces unless they blue faces
And we don't do new niggas
Cus low key they be hating
And we don't trust these bitches
Cus low key they be snaking
To be catching all these flights ain't no more catching cases
I remember trapping at it wearing the same clothes
Couldn't drip cus I kept fucking up my bankroll
I remember I was homeless had like eight hoes
Couldn't fuck cus I ain't have nowhere to take off
Could you imagine that
Abandon cribs my habitat
Hit a lick then got locked up
Lost it all and got it back
Man I swear I couldn't make this up
This my life and it's hard for me to recreate this stuff
(Man this shit be crazy cus sometimes I be sitting back and I be thinking like damn I really came from the fucking mud like young nigga done came up)
Did this shit all with my brodies
I won't switch up on my brodies
Lately shit been going done
Don't approach me lIke you know me
Niggas tryna take me out
So I keep about thirty on me
I won't let em take me out
Cus they bite they banking on me
They took my shit ain't really shit you can do to me
They took my bro now my future ain't what it used to be
We was suppose to do it all
New ice new cars
Now I'm looking to the stars
Damn we took a major lost
Now I Gotta go harder
Now I gotta be smarter
Kill a nigga for I leave my daughter
It's up to me to keep this shit in order
(Ha ha like I'll never go back to jail again you feel me I maxed out my daughter will never have to go through what I went through )
Aw yeah
And I know the streets will miss me a little I was gone but I'm back again
Thankful I ain't never gotta trap again
I won't never have to put my hands behind my back again
All my days in jail are over I ain't going back again
Whole time I was poppin I was on the run
Now I'm free I feel like my life has just begun
Hell yeah hell yeah I done maxed out
All my real niggas yeah they know what that's bout
Taking over time for me to do this shit
Mont told me no more room for the stupid shit
Feels good to be no longer a fugitive
Fuck that let's get back to this music shit
I been only going hard for about a year
But ask about in ya city bet I'm popping there
My folks still in the hood I'm tryna get em out of there
Got niggas in the jail can't wait till they get outa there
Cash rules everything dollar dollar bill
And every not I have another dream about a mil
I had fans in London way before I had a deal
Cus im the hottest youngin in my city that's for real
Name ya favorite rapper bet he ask me for a hook

For the niggas wanna murder me
What the fuck you niggas mean?

Burn they block up, third degree
That nigga lying if he saying he ain't heard of me
If I say go, no surgery, half of them niggas dead
For what they said and they deserve to be
And I can't trust a soul, Lord, forgive me
I got that led all in the church with me
I don't need nobody to do dirt for me
Ain't none of them niggas put in work for me
Don't mention my name in none of that shit
No, I ain't playing no games when it come to that shit
Got the bag, now I can't fumble that shit
I got them mad now 'cause I'm a humble, lil' bitch
You went to Famu, I went to Fam too
Think I played snare, I got the drum on the stick
Don't play fair, I play dumb on a bitch
Soon as we done, I tell her get prepared
She say, ""Say you swear"", I go numb on her
Uh-uh, can't put my tongue on her
Ayy, this my money, don't put your thumbs on it
ZaZa go in my lungs only
Ayy, fifty's go in them guns only

Line wrapped around the front yard like Krispy Kreme
Pocket full of them crispy things
Why dude come run that shit on me? Like, I ain't peeped the game
I don't even want that shit on me, he think I missed the chain
I told brodie don't miss the brain
When I get that trophy, tell 'em kissed the ring
He don't know what gun they shot him with
But I bet that nigga ain't miss the flame
I don't want him, I'm onto bigger things
Nuts crossed on me, it's a dirty game
Got niggas still in them trap spots
Trying to hit jackpot, pushing Eddie Kane
Lil' One call this bitch Alicia Keys
Don't make 'em make that choppa sing
He died when I was on tour
I don't know that boy, I don't want no problems, man
Don't let this shit be 'bout no dollars, man

I'm bringing the problems
Double entendre, triple the drama
Kill your bitch and your mama
Nigga this is an honor
Left produces like a farmer
I'm the guy in the armor
Armed and ready to harm ya
All these magazines think we fucking want their cover?
Critics and bloggers fuck and swallow and fuck each other
Get out my face screw your questions now ask another
Me and Left are getting bread ho, pass the butter
Corn Popped, game on door locked
Pure crop, smoke up it's a sure drop
I don't play that, flagrant for the playback
You fall back and lay back and stay back you stray rat

Backstabber,rap,Eminem,1996,"[Intro: Police Scanner]
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back, fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

[Verse 1]
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!
[Verse 2]
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 3]
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
To drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar
""Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya!""
[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 4]
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezin' at dust and swingin' at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 5]
Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone
[Police Voice]
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home
I repeat, he's going back to the crazy home
Job well done

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!

All my bitches got standards
Super fleek, got 'em staring
Catch me driving a McLaren
Super fast 'cause Lu dared me
All these niggas be scary
All these bitches wanna marry me
Hundred bands what I'm carrying
Let it lay in the bed with me
Growin' up poled up
Said the gang took you down, nigga so what?
Told my niggas stay down 'til we blow up
Now we got the whole north pole showed up
Duttydo on the Benz, doin' donuts
Say the word, he'll leave a nigga soulless
Put some bands on your head, that's a bonus
Have bro keep the dough if you're holding
I'm smokin' that poison, oak
Swear to God I feel chosen, whoa
Please don't take it personal
When I say I don't fuck with y'all
I don't wanna do no verse at all
On the track I'm so versatile
I don't even gotta rehearse at all
'Cause this shit come so natural
Actually, niggas ain't fuckin' with me, this shit ain't nothin' to me
Matter of fact, you niggas suckers to me, you can't get nothin' from me
Remember them nights when it wasn't nothin' to eat, stomach rumbling, no sleep
Now I got bread, niggas want somethin' from me, but it ain't nothin' for free
Every lil thing gotta come at a fee
Booked for a show that's a quarter a key
Pay for a verse, that's a two and a split
Just want a course, that's a cutie of green
Shotty in here of a deuce of the lean
Free Savage Sheen, he be ten off the beans
Might catch a body and flee from the scene
If I get caught I don't know what I seen
If I get caught I don't know not a thing
This forty cal got a beam
It's tucked off in my jeans
I'll up this bitch with ease
I'll up this bitch, let it squeeze
These niggas rats with no cheese
I got your bitch on her knees
She suck me 'til she can't breathe
So don't try to check for me, I cannot give you the recipe, that'd be the death of me
Bitches be testin' me, Glock-23 make 'em rest in peace, that is for thinkin' you preppin' me
Dear father God I just wanna say thank you for blessin' me, million times mama stressin' me
Like son you special, just wanna say thank you for telling me, 'cause it made me a better me

Fuck Faces,rap,Scarface,1998,"[Verse 1: Scarface]
Man, I met this chick so fine
So bad she made me sick sometimes
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in The Galleria shopping
Buying gifts for some guy that she dating, still jocking
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs, she started smiling
So I handed her this bathing suit, and told her ""Try it""
Replied, ""Why?"" with light brown eyes
""I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size""
She put it on so I paid for it, and then I told her she could keep it
Then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it, made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I've done it, made mack move with girl chasing me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless, but honey must've missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just humping and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes, she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, it's me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces
[Chorus: Devin the Dude]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
I called her up on the phone, said ""I'll be there in a minute""
'Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good, have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all that shit
Every chance you get, you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her, got to stop and look
'Cause she so damn fine, bitch
I want to make you mine, bitch
I want to fuck one time, bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind, bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with, stuck with
I love the way she suck dick, and make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't, I knew the bitch would
'Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you know you ain't gon' last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
'Cause it's like that
That's how we do this shit, bitch

Let me holla at 'cha, B; Short, check this
Just got through fucking this bitch
Who swallowed my cum and drunk my piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or move it
Sucking and fucking, mayne, she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6, nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch, and she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all the time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas, dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me, chewing my nuts like bologna
Then click, she licked on my dick like plop
Then nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said ""Look what I got""
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard and rock is what these hoes be missing
And in return, she used a stolen credit card to by me cases
And later on she get this bone and gives me fuck faces

I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying it's about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we gon' do is fall through with crushed ice
Man, these hoes been talking 'bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick, it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and it's quiet
The Remy that she give me, and feel me, it's tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties, so damn me, it's in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat-ass eyes
Rochelle who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See, I love these kind 'cause they ain't with that bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl, stop licking right there, you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and feel the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me sit through
Damn hoe, I must admit, that's why I dig you
So I put you to the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex chases

You know what I'm saying, baby? It's either now or never
Too $hort, Tela, Devin, Scarface in style

You ain't grow up in a city that's so poor
You ain't grow up in a place known for war
You ain't ever hide money in the floorboards
You ain't ever serve scummy to your own whores
Your man ain't never had a belt so he used yours
Tied his arm off miss the vein then he hit the floor
You ain't never ran a train with four boys
When the bitch got pregnant hope its not yours
You ain't never had to smile at a funeral when you know he was a rat and he deserved to go
Everybody lookin for they own pot of gold I'm just lookin in the sky for the rainbow

They don't rely on you pussy they don't rely on you
When its lunch time they don't be like whats the move
When its crunch time I ain't got nothin to prove
But if we don't go and hunt then there's no food
I don't talk I lead by example
Ill die for anything that I stand for
I'm a bando commando slash rambo slash will get on your ass for a bag tho
You ain't earn your name through violence
You ain't earn your trust through silence

Lick shots then we run from them sirens

Man you sussy boys, are you hungry?
I see you tryna bite my sound but it’s sounding kinda funky

And them dollars made my spidey sense a-ring a-ring ring
And that booty on that thottie
Made me spring a-spring spring
Then I took her to my pad
Made her sing a-sing sing
First she ask me for a fling
Now she clingy cling cling
And shes bossy
But she threw it
Boy you hella saucy
Did you stew it?
Wonder what it cost me, I threw some shoes in
Ice be on my body
I'm never bruising
Aye

Aye, let me break it down
I got a bad bitch tryna jump my bones
And her booty round
Aye you see my whips on fleek
Yea pink flames, pink Fiat, baby is a treat
Yeah of course I'm eating all my salads cause they stuffed with greens
Yeah this baby's got the German coochie
It really made me scream
So I might just tour the world and grab the bag
I'm really keen
Yeah I'm really on that goofy shit but ain't no Charlie Sheen

Paparazzi after my shows askin' me questions
God fed up with my soul so ain't no blessin's
Happiness can't be bought or sold, I learned my lesson
Now I see what fame will really get you;
Bottle by the nightstand, that ease the stresses
Dealin' with depression, pills on the dresser
Fiendin' for affection so I'm buying out the section
Now I see what fame will really get you

[Verse 1]
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
That lifestyle left a lot of rich folk brainless
To the temple, yeah we were broke but that life was simple
Besides, food is food, water is water, air is air, the rest is mental
I did without until I did within
I said on beat what I wrote in pen
I gave my all without givin' in
But it's a thin line between heavenly divine and a livin' a life of sin
Speak in codes to my worthy friends
Greenroom full, I pray we ain't let the devil in
A lot of faces I don't know, a lot of ""where you been's?""
Like you was really lookin' for me when I was in the wind
Life is just a game now, I really got my aim down to shoot for stars
I ain't been to church in years and it ain't even far
This ain't even half of the battle, I ain't even start
All I do is record, I see what fame will really get you

I bought a bottle just to soothe my soul
Still crying over granny, that was some years ago
I'm a man now, I came up to hold my fam down
Can't tell them about my depression 'cause most them fans now
Got to protect myself at all times
I know some partners that been sued by their bloodline
Lord forbid I let my blood down
The first time I say no, guess we ain't blood now
Scared, me as a businessman is like all they see
Justin Scott trapped as Big K.R.I.T. screamin', ""It's really me""
When it was only us it was only love, how could this be?
When fallin' out for some is not gettin' the V.I.P
And a simple conversation means we talkin' work
To play a song that's almost perfect but it need my verse
You got an artist, but I'm family, but you need a purse
You hit the city but don't call me first, that's what fame gets you

The slash of a blade against flesh
Heavy breathing

Happy Friday the 13th, Motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Go to sleep little boy, don't cry
Black shadows on the wall
Don't look under your bed
Hear footsteps in the hall
Somebody gonna come get me
And take me to the woods, in the fall
Don't look under your bed
Crucifix on the wall
Could it be in my mind
My time has come by
Slayed in the field
Left here to die
What if mamma finds me like this
Under this dirt still alive
I don't know how to resist
All of these thoughts that are running through my little mind
Trouble on show
Scared for my life
Still I want WAR!
[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
In a world that could feel like a fucking cage I just sit inside it
Instead of trying to escape I became crazy and started smiling
Took a knife to the back when I turned around to help somebody close
But I bled just enough to live, half man half ghost
And the dream is dark, fuck it into the dark I go
You want me to be a monster and kill them
You want me to be the one with the blade
You want me to stand up and SCREAM!
You beg for me to go into a rage
Well hand me the machete then, right now
I'll walk into the house and lay you down
Bring you the head of every victim
Man..
Woman..
Child..
I will not decieve you
God said I'll never leave you
And since I can't see you
Then I have to believe you
Yeah I've got a dream
And I've seen
Many, many nightmares unfold
But fear has no hold
On this dream that I control
I control
I control
I control

[Kian] So go ahead and keep on doing your thing, but promise us this:
[Both] PLEASE DON'T SING
[Jc] Why you gotta sing? Please don't try to steal the show. He try to do hip hop but he know he bad though. Just stick to Vine, play some pranks on your teacher instead of trying to find other YouTube kids to feature

(Speaking)
[Kian] Whoa whoa whoa, what YouTubers are you talking about?
[Jc] I'm kidding man, they're all good...
[Both] Ha! PSYCH

[Kian] You don't need no music, your channel's fantastic; like when you kiss your teenage girlfriend trying to guess her chapstick. So stick to all the tweeting, the generic ones you say like 'Good morning, you're perfect, have a beautiful day'

[Kian] Now we're not being mean, we don't want your feelings to get hurt
[Jc] Oh no no
[Kian] But if this just seems cold then you can wear my sweatshirt
[Jc] It's an extra large
[Kian] So we're just saying it wouldn't be a bad thing
[Jc] Not a bad thing, baby
[Kian] To leave the songs to people who can- (speaks) Jc hit that high note, baby!
[Jc] Sing!
[Kian speaking] Whoa, alright. Relax

Still, in the same room as an infant
My vision so distant
Term paper due but I got no thesis
Torn into pieces, I'll be back next weekend

Drop the Mic w/ David Schwimmer and Rebel Wilson,rap,James Corden,2016,"[Verse 1: James Corden]
Millennials, let me introduce you to this guy
His name is David, he was famous in '95
Cause that's when he was on TV then
Now it's 2016 and he has no ""Friends""
Get it? No friends, not famous ever again
He was a Kardashian on TV but that was only for pretend
You played Robert and that was a great combo
But you are so white, you shoulda probably played the Bronco
What I'm saying is, this battle's a blockbuster
So I'm sad, I know you're going to spit something lacklustre
But now you got the chance to prove you've got balls
While I ignore you like Jennifer Aniston does your calls

[Verse 2: David Schwimmer]
A Brit in America's your one claim to fame
We all know as an actor your roles were all the same
The heavy best friend, the humorous sidekick
With a belly so big you can't find your own...
Dickens, the author we all read as kids
He's British like you, but people know who he is
You must be a masochist, you want to battle me?
This won't end well, mate, it's not ""Love, Actually""
To be clear, I love the English, I married your kind
But why your wife chose you: my bad, she blind?

Rap was born in this country, you're a tourist here
Do us a favor, James, just change your career

[Verse 3: James Corden]
Ohhh, come on, David Schwimmer!
How are you such a loser when your name rhymes with winner?
You're so one-note with every role that you play
I'm like hey, I didn't know Ross from ""Friends"" knew O.J.!
I'm a fast car, quickly passing you in NASCAR
I'm an animal, you just voiced on in ""Madagascar""
Oh, he's surprised, didn't know that I could slay
What's the matter? No one told you life was gonna be this way?
And one thing, you're not a true M.C
I ******* destroyed you, this was Must See TV
I'm sorry this battle has left you so blue
But unlike this crowd: I'll be there for you...

[Verse 4: David Schwimmer]
Destroy me? Please, your rhymes totally blew
I worked with a monkey had more skills than you
I'm not worried, no one heard a word that you said
The only people watch your show are asleep or dead
You're late night, I'm primetime, you're cola, I'm fine wine
Go home, you're done, this battle is mine
Did you think I'd be scared, walk around gingerly?
When everyone knows your middle name is Kimberley?
I'm tall and lean, you're short and stout
They know me in Japan, they know you at In 'n' Out
You embarrass your country, this was easy for me
Bitch, lay down the mic and go make me some tea

One cream, one sugar

[Verse 5: Rebel Wilson]
Alright stop, enough of this clapping
Why the hell do you wanna hear two white men rapping?
I'm the Rebel M.C., I'm crack-a-lackin'
I come packing boobs, show these dudes what they're lacking
David, your career, it's a huge mistake
It's like Ross and Rachel: it's on a break
All jokes aside, man, I think you're great
I'm your biggest fan, when I was eight
Carpool Karaoke, you think it's your big thing
But everyone is thinking ""Shut up and let Adele sing!""

You speak English, but you can't even rap
Your rhymes are nonexistent like my inner thigh gap
Don't battle me, 'cause you know it's not worth it
Everybody knows my rhymes are Pitch Perfect!",11855,46847

One More Time,rap,Tabi Bonney,2012,"[Hook x2]
One more time, before you go
Can we, do it again

She told me what she made of
I found out more when we made love
How 'bout a encoure 'til we destruct
Do we need to always creep when we meet up
Steady making moves, this is day two
She quick on her feet, she rocking J's too
If I made you my girl, would we be true?
Or would we still be emotionally unavailable?
Your convenience is always convenient
Love the way you bob your head in agreement
You get rewarded for all of your achievements
Can we tape record it and privately screen it
Just a question, you Kim K destined
Them girls gon' hate but you just say F them
When me and you get together, no stressing
Let me know when we gon' do another session
[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Phil Ade]
Oh baby give me one more chance
If not at love, let me get in them pants
I know it's my fault, I'mma fuck up
I always been humble, but my dick been stuck up
Shit got a mind of its own, hoes stroke its ego
I been tryna keep 'em at bay, Montego
But Clicquot and Rose to the head got 'em shipping out
And they be going off top, no written outs
I made you sit and doubt, if we would ever work
I knew that if we ever severed, it would never hurt
But once again, I was wrong
Now I got nothing left to do but beg on this song
So this is like Jodeci mixed with some Hova see
I been tryna grind, get mines here and overseas
You know it's hard for a nigga like Phil
So regardless of how you might feel, we should do it...

Fall and your ass won't get up, nah

Six Feet Deep,rap,Geto Boys,1993,"There's far too many of you dying

[Verse 1:  Scarface]
June twenty-eight was the date
Thirty-eight to the chest plate
Mommy dear's cryin at the wake
And everybody's dressed up in black suits
Goin to pay their last respects to the black troop
Why'd he have to die is the question that we're under
But everyone knows that every day's a different number
So when your time comes, just remember, G
You'll always have a place in this world as a memory
Especially my boys who passed away back in '92
Best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin
Of how we hung in the clubs smokin and drinkin
Never missin out on a hood fight
Cause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight
Everything has changed and people are lookin lonely
It's gon' be strange spendin New Year's Eve without your homie
But ain't much that we can do
Except pour brew throughout the crew
To make sure we all remember you
And believe me it hurts
To see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt... dirt
[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Another homie got smoked but it's no surprise
Everybody's trippin cause the boy was too young to die
A sad sight to see my homie take his last breath
Everybody's trippin cause they can't accept my homie's death
Another killin was reported on the evenin news
Somebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes
In the midst of all this shit I think about myself
Wonderin when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf
But I refuse to be another violent casualty
So when I'm rollin I pack my pistol grip beside my knee
Cause on the city streets today a brother just can't win
When the people you think are your friends really ain't your friends
Uh, and Bushwick can't sleep
When everybody around me keeps fallin six feet deep

[Verse 3: Scarface]
The pain that's deep inside of everybody grows
As they approach to see the body before the casket close
The person standin next to me has snapped a flick
Once I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it
The whole entire family spoke on his defense
The choir sung the songs that make us reminisce
And durin all the singin I broke down myself
When I looked and seen the family that my partner left
And then the choir broke into its final song
Thinkin to myself the worst is yet to come
Everyone was headed for the final flight
As we creeped along the gravel on the burial site
The director said his words and there was not a sound
As they lowered my little partner towards inside the ground
Everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top
And then they work alone with the concrete block
And that's deep
[Verse 4: Big Mike]
A lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry
I watch tears fall down from their eyes
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to take the chance
They chose the music, so they had to dance
Couldn't tell him nothin, was a player, had to have it
Got caught up in the game now my boy's in the casket
And everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame
Ashamed to let his mother know that he was in the game
We used to kick it on the ave at night
Comin up tryin to have the finer things in life
But now my boy's gone, I wish he was at home
I wish he wouldn'ta never fell victim to the chrome
So when I drink a brew for you I pour some on the block, son
You might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten
So long, remember whenever or wherever
Dead or alive, real partners come together
And you know that",30261,24341

[Verse 2: Dave East]
If I don't know you, you gon' see how I react in the photo (Facts)
In DC with the package on me, meet me at the go-go
Hid the dimes in my drawers, the Knicks look like NoDoz
Me and Pooch chop in the mornin', we really sew O's
If I'm the next heathen (uh), I'ma make sure I'm the best breathin'
Forty on me, no jeans, it's sweat season (Sweats)
I know my past hoes, they regret leavin' (I know)
I coulda died in that crash, really regret speedin' (My bad)
Ghost and Dave is complimented by no one, nigga
I be in the Bay just conversatin with growers (What it cost?)
All your favorite actresses love me, I really know 'em (Hey)
Gemstar under that Gucci, I really blow 'em (On God)
Pause that, runnin' in buildings but not I'm off that
Used to be in taps, switch phones before I call back
Twenty-nine, almost thirty, still got my flag on me
I ain't dead or in jail so my mama could brag on me (Mama)
Think I'm deliverin' mail, I got that bag on me
I already know they gon' tell, I got a mask on me (Mask)
If you wanna new job, nigga, just ask homie
You a pumper, I know your boss used to get packs from me
Brian Pump ass niggas just want some pussy (Damn)
Rollin' up cookie, watchin' movies about Tookie
If you lackin' the real, I'm what your life needs
Told my Cali shorty to meet me on thirty-ninth street, uh

The Ghost and The Paranoid, playin' East shit (Yeah)
Cold-hearted nigga guaranteed to let the heat get
Tryna pray, got some shit to weigh and I'm leafless (Hahaha)
If I shoot first, I ain't got to sweat the defense
Used to know the story, I ain't gotta set the pretense (Nah)
Play the Hudson river, bring the chains and the cement (Bring it all)
I'm a gangsta nigga, tell your bitch to suck the semen

I was in the U.K. thinkin', shit don't feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Hard to say you care about me
When this mink draggin' to the floor
Tryna find a PYT, I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathes
It's hard to breathe on my own
It's somethin' 'bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, since Evisu
Made her switch sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chickens, then mail them
Take 'em to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, you never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga I got the sack for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change, the family loves the way it is
Fame change, a ho loves the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way

Ain't really mean to hurt you

It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the fuckin' carbon, hit him with the tool
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I've been put up against, baby
You see why I've been tryna make the rent, baby
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Dime rose, 'bout to get lynched, baby
It's hard to caress you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motors, my confession
Tryna identify, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept me

Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you

Hot tenderoni, Bobby Brown ooh
Shawty so phony, I got somethin' to prove
Work every day like I got somethin' to lose
Oxycont' got me flown up, nothin' new
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Money stacked up and it got me seduced
I got that hot dope, but I got that boost though
Ayy, my Lamb hit a pothole
These bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo
Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto!
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mi ana
Yolanda, Sholanda, Miyana, mi casa
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
It became problems when I didn't send flowers
King like Mufasa, messiah, then higher
Goshies and Rollies, yeah, fuck all the police
Shout out my woadie, he smashin' the C.O
My wrist got an ego, my watch in an igloo
We took illegal, got stripes like a zebru
Pimp like a rollin' stone, high when I greet you
Diamonds just fall on you, effortlessly ball on you
L-O-to-V-E, hope you ain’t get greedy
Chasers do numbers, man chains is on Fiji
Kidnapped your heart 'cause you gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Geezy
Shout out to DiDi, got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian? Super sensation
Yah, sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches betrayed me
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity, shinin' is therapy

Yeah I'ma get this one off for 87th Street
South Side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere, check it
It's like come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town

[Verse 1]
I stagger in the gatherin'
Possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin'
Over the global, my vocals be travellin', unravellin' my abdomen
It's slime that's babblin', grammatics that are masculine
I grab them in, verbally badgerin' broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
Raps I make up like blacks do excuses
I feel like Noah, hookin' my mellows up on deuces
If a broad ain't got a mind, a job or crib, she useless
Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines
They say signs of the end is near
I wonder can I walk a righteous path holdin' a beer?
Got more verses than a Kramer, go off like a pager
Skills uglier than Craig Mack in your ear, I'm the flavor
My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise
Don't watch the Bulls as much (Why?)
They got too many white boys
A million black men walkin' towards one direction
For sure, the cream of the planets... resurrection
[Scratched]
""Resurrection""

[Verse 2]
A prophet, raised among Black Disciples and Vice Lords
Who don't give a fuck about mic cords, at night, swords get up
Together black wrists get cuffed
I'm wishin' for a change, my man want his change in a cup
Yes Sir, I'm in the Mix-a-Lot
Bitches put 'em on the glass while I'm puttin' stickers on they ass
I rule everything around me like cash
On the rocks of reality, dreams get splashed
In jams, I mash like Alan Alda
Niggas nod, thangs say ""Hey"" as if I was Little Walter
87 strip walker, taught the code of the area
By stayin', within the barrier
Exposed to Stony stimuli, with that I identify
Brothers went through my rotate solidify the realness
Skull caps, Smurfs, Puffy jacket, Lugz boots on
Steppin' to me is like goin' to the County being a Neutron

1, 2, 1, 2, we'll get on down, check it
[Verse 3]
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike
When in dim light, I use insight to enlight
Then write somethin' that's skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights, I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
Doodoo-Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo, I got it made
I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums, hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggas
Now my speech and thought's quicker
Cruisin' South Side streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
87 got my back and we don't get no thicker
Chicago got my back and we don't... now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
When it's my turn to go I gotta go, and I'm gone with the storm...

I believe that someone can be brave on this green earth
But maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m wrong

Turn dreams to reality
The king of principality
Shines upon me
The holy spirit shadows me
I write songs for fun not for salary
Used to collect guns now the truth is my cavalry
But I gotta closet full just in case the project pulls some wicked bullshit
My logistics is logical
Turn you back to molecules, minuscule follicles
Then convert your brain to subatomic particles
I breathe you in, I sneeze you out
You MC’s, you live in degrees of doubt
That’s why I swarm on your college dorm
Make knowledge born from the hood to the cottage farm
London to Russia
Eurasia to Prussia
The holy cities of it the east the young shieks discuss us
Christ means crusher
We come along to usher the righteous way of life
It’d be most wise for the civilized man to trust us
On Bora Bora, we discuss the Torah
Then we travel across these lands like old explorers

I believe that someone can be brave on this green earth
But maybe I’m wrong, aim for the sun
Out in the freezing rain, I will stay on the streets all day
Until my cup runneth over
We always fight blind the light of our lives
My patience is waning, the scales have capsized
I read news full of glory
And there's pyres of files alight feeding mazes
To the night sky

[RZA]
Sittin’ on a porch, torching a stogie in the moonlight
Rockin’ back and forth in my chair, contemplating life
Thinking where I went wrong, where I went right
Was it a fast? Or a long life
From my calculation, everyday sensational
Every sense were stimulated, pains occasional
All praise is due to the father, the author
The supreme architect, the one with no partner
We give man the wisdom to be a gardner, carpenter
Priest or warrior, king or you can be a scholar
Husband wife child mother brother sister or father
All these things the heart consists of
Keep the planet floating gigantic like atlantic ocean
7 ounces deflect, reject
All satanic notions
We so elusive
[Banks]
I believe that someone can be brave on this green earth
But maybe I’m wrong, aim for the sun
Out in the freezing rain, I will stay on the streets all day
Until my cup runneth over
Runneth over
Runneth over
Runneth over
Now I see there’s some way to be free as a sea bird
And maybe I’m gone, straight for the sun
Out in the freezing rain, I will stay on the streets all day
Cause my cup runneth over",4218,88027

[Rick Grimes]
Carl, stay back, this is gonna get bad
I'm 'bout show this lab rat how to be a real dad
A grade-A MC who will ruin your A1 day
Cause Sheriff Grimes rhymes dirty like my armpit stains
I'm a post-apocalyptic cop who's got a lot of issues
Pop a cap in you and splatter the brain you misuse
Cooking up Blue Sky and bigger lies for Skyler
Hatching little schemes like a dying MacGyver
You tore your family apart, sin by sin
Where I live, it happens literally, limb from limb
So write this down in your pancakes so you won't forget it
I kill zombies that are better men than you before breakfast
[Walter White]
I don't know what you think I've done
But if we were to battle, I've already won
Ask Gus, you don't wanna face off against me
I'll stuff you in a barrel and make a dude smoothie (huaugh!)
Your sense of duty gets your group into some deep doody
Always getting saved by some samurai booty
I'm a kingpin, cookin' crystal in the middle of the day
Having dinner by the pool with the DEA
Run you over with my Aztek; GTA
If you ever try to stop Heisenberg gettin' paid
Here's a hot dose, let me watch you choke on the truth
You look up to me like I'm a pizza on the roof
'Cause you're a loser, a failure to your whole entire crew
I've seen Walter Jr. handle walkers better than you

CARL! I said stay back with the others
While I finish this bitch like you finished your mother
You ain't the danger to me, Walt, so knock all you want
I'll watch you get eaten on my fuckin' front lawn

Your monsters don't frighten me, and you can bite me
I'll be standing right here in my tighty Walter Whities (huaugh!)

[Verse 1]
I'm as bad, bad as Leroy Brown, Brown
I'm a pro p-pro, but not a noun n-noun
If you got beef, beef, you get ground, ground
Cut up and sold, sold, by the pound for pound
I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound
Not of rebound, but like a hound, I get down
Never wore a leash but I'm a show ya
How loose is my goose, got more soul than combat boots
(""I got soul, you got it!"") That's why I came
They keep callin me, man, they keep callin me, they call my name
Ese I can't - give it away, give it away now!
Or say when, say what?! Or say how
Shh okay between you and me man what's all this white rap?
I Got the Power! And I just, I just might Snap
Bum ba-bum, bum bum!!
Think fast... cause I'm the Ramadan
Ahoy-he-hoy-he, I'm Fat Boy
Shibidabibidabee, boom boom, I'll be the bad boy
Having a party, but I'm not a Democrat
Spoiled as a child, but now I'm milk like similac
Don't have Cinemax, because my cable's pirated
Bug out wit the rhyme, try to swat and I'll get fly wit it
For pest control, I suggest some soul
As far as dick I got it but I have no breath control
So gimme a T.O. baby like umm, Chris Webber
I got myself together
Now I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight
Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake

Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
Can't no A&R tell me that I ain't got soul
C'mon, can I get a clap?
Can't you see I'm trapped, and I'm so confused
Dues is gettin' paid but what about the bills
I wanna make some dough yet I wanna show my skills
Do you even know where I'm goin?
I ain't scared of you motherfucker, though I am of the Omen
I jam like a Cult but make note, I'm not Koresh
Cause I control minds with rhymes
So FBI don't test, I got a no. 2 pencil
And I'm a scribble all over your faaaace!
You see I don't pack no gat
I didn't see CB4 cause I heard that shit was wack
Like Chris, I Rock, I'm strapped like my jock
Peace to No ID and my nigga Y-not!

Fatter than Dre, a Lover like Ed, super as Clark Kent
So gimme the Lane, Lois as I change clothes without a booth
And light high ish like woof
The roof is on fire, it's not an L.A. riot
I got more ho, ho ho's than the Jolly Green Giant
Large as the Professor and I'm never faking funk, akh
Fat as heavy metal yet I'm harder than punk rock

I got skills like Tim, and I'm coming in a Hardaway

Yesterday saw you missing
Drawn to the light in the distance
Holding her hand while she listened
She told him how much she would miss him
Said his goodbyes to his children
And let the weight fade away

[Verse 2: Ben Barlow & Laura Whiteside (together)]
I have your hands
But I have my mother's eyes
Your tact and poise
And her sense of wrong and right
Heard you awake in the middle of the night
Letting go of the things you keep inside

Worked your fingers to the bone
To be sent home with a cardboard box
Filled with everything you've known
All things come to be loved and lost

I'll keep a moment sealed in time inside a picture frame
A small reminder of the days I thought would never change
They always say it's clear to see
How parts of you shine through in me
I think you know, you won't be here forever
And you're counting down the days
'Til you can rest your tired eyes and let it slip away

The lessons learned at your side
Will stay with me all my life
The man I hope to become, I know is deep down inside

The Dark Half,rock,Above the Broken,2012,"[Verse 1]
There is something that you're always running from
But you can't run from me
I am your conscience speaking and this is
What I see... I see the fear in your eyes
As you run & hide
Your body's going numb, you're slowly dying on the inside

This feeling haunts me everyday
The only thing to do is pray

No one can save me from myself or this hell I've created
I'm trapped in my mind, it's a prison cell
When did I become so jaded?

[Chorus]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Is there any point at all?
The reflection that I see
Only shines to show me
Better days and better nights
And better times when I felt alive
The deception that I see
Has sadly taken over me
I cannot run, I cannot hide
I cannot find myself tonight
I know, I know
This isn't easy
When you let go, let go
The pain stops
Because I know it's hard to see now
But I promise, it'll be okay
I know, I know
This isn't easy
When you let go, let go
The pain stops
Because I know it's hard to see now
But I promise you that we can change

Yeah!

[Verse 2]
This all makes me sick to my stomach
Urgh!
You can't run from your past so give it up
I see the void inside my eyes, it's always calling
I hear the voice I try to hide, it's always calling
I can't always believe what's looking back at me
All these voices that I hear
Are they angels?
Are they demons?
Or the dark half that I fear?

You'll figure it out
And know that you got time before you figure it out
Everything will be fine if you forget all about
The ones who don't know why you haven't seen them around
But you pass through their towns
I know you're sick of them now
Cause high school wasn't nice to you
And when you got out
The same jackasses followed you
And kicked you around
Some of them were your bosses too
The world's a small town
Just can't find your way out, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
They'll laugh at you, you can't be true
It's overwhelming to
Point that you don't know, if
You're still real, or how to feel
You're losing your appeal
What a poor performance now
[Chorus]
And shouldn't I know?
I was the one who carried the show
But I'm first to tell you now
They shouldn't care
About whoever's pulling your hair
And you'll make up that what you will
It's not my problem
It's not your problem if you want
You call the shots and they do not

[Verse 2]
Moving ahead
Sounds easier than it really is
Noise in your head is breaking up your sentences
You've already said enough to make them hate you
So now shoot from your hip
And don't stop 'til those motherfuckers
Are filled with lead
Of course, don't take that literal; I'm not Eminem
No, I can't go to court and they don't need to be dead
Instead, say ""fuck off kindly"", and get on with your shit
I mean, it's their life they're pissin' away

[Pre-Chorus]
It's funny how they sit around
Their longest fingers out
To point out how you waste life
Break them off, I'd rather not
I'm scared that if we touch
You'll wind up keeping me in line

And shouldn't I know?
I was the one who carried the show
But I'm first to tell you now
That they shouldn't care
About whoever's pulling your hair
And you'll make of that what you will

It's not your problem if you want
So say what you want, but
First, figure out what you should want

I thought it was me
But it wasn’t

Before anything had happened
I was thinking that the end should be tragic

In my friend’s photographs

But I obviously hadn’t

Just walk away and don’t even bother

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in, like cattle you run
Stripped of
Your life's worth
Human mice, for the angel of death
Four hundred thousand more to die

Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying, without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race
Surgery, with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down, screaming out to die

Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time
'Till you rip yourselves apart

Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The Holocaust

Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down
Your blood's running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants he's creating

Pathetic harmless victims
Left to die
Rancid angel of death
Flying free

She went to the Taco Zone and got a burrito, a quesadilla, and a side of chorizo
And then she saw the most horrible sight that she’s ever seen in her horrible life
On the side of the burning quesadilla shell was the smiling face of Jesus Christ

She don’t have no time for heavy Jesus in her life
The only religion that she’s known is rock and roll
She don’t have no time for heavy Jesus in her life
The only religion that she’s known is rock and roll

Everybody wanted to know how he was, “Was he cool, was he chill, was he cruel just because?
Did he condemn her life and all the choices she’s made or was he like, ‘No worries, babe, get laid?’
Did he wrap her in a blanket of love from above, did he heal the hurt in her heart with the touch of a dove?”
She said she didn’t even need to wait around to discover cause life’s too short to believe in another

For the Sun to come and melt this snow

And we'll hold our heads up knowing that he's fine
We'd all be lucky to have a love like that in a lifetime

Should we still save his chair?
Should we still buy him gifts?

Shit you've done, things you've said
And it's grounding, grounding
I've been feeling three feet tall this month
Hardly indestructible
But the snow melts, and the rhythm still goes on
An angel got his wings
And we'll hold our heads up knowing that he's fine

That I cut off a piece of the baby Jesus

'Cause the piece of the baby I cut off it bled and it bled

I tried everything
I tried bandages and shit
I tried praying to it
But all to no avail

Nothing could keep the baby Jesus from bleeding
Oh no, nothing would keep the baby Jesus from bleeding

I got to stop having these dreams
They are killing me inside
They are killing me alive
They are ruining my soul
But nothing could keep these dreams from hurting me
No no, nothing could keep these dreams from fucking me up

And then the worst thing happened
The baby opened his eyes
And he stared into mine
And he started to speak

He said ""Listen boy I'm gonna throw you in hell
I'm gonna make you scream I'm gonna make you yell
I'm gonna make you wish that I never saved you, you ungrateful prick""

So if you wanna be afraid of Jesus now
'Cause his heart's filled with vengeance
And his soul's filled with hellfire
And he's thirsty for blood

Be afraid of Jesus, be afraid of Jesus
Be afraid of Jesus 'cause he's gonna fuck you up old school style

I take some dope, I feel so sick
It's a sick world, sick, sick, sick
Drugs and bitches and junkies and fags
Artificial phonies, I hate it, hate it

Wake Up Exhausted,rock,Tegan and Sara,2004,"[Verse 1]
I wake up exhausted it's not morning
It's back to sleep to re-dream me
We're alone and we're happy
But there you are, angry with me

[Chorus]
Are you alright?
I can stand up straight
Are you alright?
Can you get me off your mind?

[Verse 2]
I hated this city before you came here
So let go and move on
We're strangers, we're not friends

Soon to be a place that's just filled up
And I found out that you're angry
And you're sorry you ever met me

You're falling way behind
We'll give it just a little bit of time
'Cause when we're all exposed
Do you want to be the first in line?
Those bewitching crowds
The smoke they blow, can make your head pop
The ego is playing its tricks on you again and again

[Chorus]
We blow all our chances thinkin' we know
All the answers, and so it goes
With all the changes, nothing changes
No matter what you're told

[Verse 2]
So you're picking up signs
You're scared you might be losing your mind
And all the hopes of any shot you've got
Are leaving you behind
You're making light of this I know
And it's a shame
That your silly sentimental heart is to blame

We blow all our chances thinkin' we know
All the answers, and so it goes
With all the changes, nothing changes
No matter what you're told

You better hold on tight
Odds will turn to evens when you're upside down
You gotta hold on tight
I don't want to be there when you hit the ground
You need to hold on tight

We blow all our chances thinkin' we know
All the answers, and so it goes
With all the changes and nothing changes
No matter what you're told",4823,47218

And I wanna tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it, so let's December it

I got my feet on the ground, and family above
Can you send some happiness with my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me""

Saraband,rock,Corpus Delicti,1994,"She sleep in the rivers bed
Drunk of her sadness
Her head head the dwelling of deepest torment
Of deepest lament
Caressing the water like ice
She shakes her head until
Her spirit finds the reason of her fright
The words you meant to tell will never be
Your dreaming of violence
With secret the ocean has to keep
The evil hand hangs on your ship


And oh ""We're so different, when I'm cold an silent
You're setting a fire to dry your heart""
They're jumping and dancing and loving and kissing
On an on
They're dying and bleeding and hating and sighing
On an on

I take my trust in you""
She swims in the rivers bed, possessed by her feelings
The moon fades in the gloomy expense
That dreft her naked skin
Caressing water like marsh
She joins her hands until
Her body finds the reason of her thrill
The words you meant to tell will never be
You're diving in silence
Like a mermaid in the dreary sea
The evil hands inside of him

And oh ""We're so different, when I'm cold an silent

She died in the rivers bed
Drowned by her sorrow
The waves carried her body in shreds
Her soul will follow

He's diving with sadness in unknown, dark and spellbound seas
The fading moon will shine on him

Doom Over Dead Man,rock,Amon Amarth,2011,"The autumn clouds are caving in
And night comes crawling black as sin
Lightning strikes and rain begins
A storm that tears my soul
I toss and twist all in my bed
My thoughts are spinning in my head
Darkness nears soon I'll be dead
I'm losing all control

I spent my life in foolish quest
For gold and riches I'd contest
And now I'm left with just regrets
Too late to change my ways
My life it seems has slipped away
I leave no legacy to praise
Nothing more for me to say
My life has been a waste

When!
When time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave awaits for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?
When!
When time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave awaits for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?
So I die but won't be mourned
Broken and alone
I wish that I were never born
So I die and won't be missed
No rune stone will be raised
As my body rots away

Die!
All friends and cattle pass away
Die!
And death will come for every man!
Die!
But I know one thing never dies
Doom!
The sentence passed upon the dead!

Now!
The time has come for me to leave
Now!
And judgment's passed upon my life
Now!
Now I will rest in my dark grave
Will!
They speak my name with reverence?

My life has been a waste!
No rune stone will be raised!
So I die, but won't be mourned!
I wish that I were never born!
I rest here in my shallow grave!
As my body rots away!",2333,78536

Through the core

I could die

We could fly

I could never be

And watch me burn
Watch me burn
You watch me burn
As i wither away
You are shaden by gray
As i wither away
Come fuckin blow me away

What you wanted me to be

Cause i'm falling faster

The river is deep and the river is wide
And the girl that I love is on the other side
She wants to move to Kansas City
Move to Kansas City
Move, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue

She is walking down Ellum, turning down Main
Trying to find someone to sell her cocaine
She wants to move to Kansas City
Move to Kansas City
Move, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue

[Verse 3]
With a day full of promises dead on her lips
Mark 15:34 tucked next to her hip
She wants to move to Kansas City
Move to Kansas City
Move, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue

Well, I jumped in the water and started to drown
I thought of her walking and turned back around
I want to move to Kansas City
Move to Kansas
I want, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue

With her pair of old wings that opened just once
She can walk on two feet now, she can go where she wants
She can even move to Kansas City

Move, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue

And I'll tell you one thing that you should never do
Never let no woman tell you she loves you

Thick as a Brick,rock,Jethro Tull,1972,"[PART ONE]

[1. Really Don't Mind / See There a Son Is Born (0:00 - 5:00)]

[Verse 1]
Really don't mind if you sit this one out
My word's but a whisper, your deafness a shout
I may make you feel but I can't make you think
Your sperm's in the gutter, your love's in the sink
So you ride yourselves over the fields
And you make all your animal deals
And your wise men don't know how it feels

[Refrain]
To be thick as a brick

[Verse 2]
And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away
In the tidal destruction, the moral melee
The elastic retreat rings the close of play
As the last wave uncovers the newfangled way
But your new shoes are worn at the heels
And your suntan does rapidly peel
And your wise men don't know how it feels
[Refrain]
To be thick as a brick

[Verse 3]
And the love that I feel
Is so far away
I'm a bad dream
That I just had today
And you shake your head
And say it's a shame

[Verse 4]
Spin me back down the years
And the days of my youth
Draw the lace and black curtains
And shut out, the whole truth
Spin me down the long ages
Let them sing the song

[Verse 5]
See there! A son is born
And we pronounce him fit to fight
There are black-heads on his shoulders
And he pees himself in the night
We'll make a man of him
Put him to a trade
Teach him to play Monopoly
And how to sing in the rain
[3:36 - 5:00 - Instrumental]

[2. The Poet and the Painter (5:00 - 10:29)]

[5:00 - 6:09 - Instrumental]

[Verse 6]
The Poet and the Painter
Casting shadows on the water
As the sun plays on the infantry
Returning from the sea
The do-er and the thinker
No allowance for the other
As the failing light illuminates
The mercenary's creed
The home fire burning
The kettle almost boiling
But the master of the house
Is far away
The horses stamping
Their warm breath clouding
In the sharp and frosty morning
Of the day
And the poet lifts his pen
While the soldier sheaths his sword
[Refrain 2]
And the youngest of the family
Is moving with authority
Building castles by the sea
He dares the tardy tide
To wash them all aside, oh

[7:21 - 9:21 - Instrumental]

[Verse 7]
The cattle quietly grazing
At the grass down by the river
Where the swelling mountain water
Moves onward to the sea
The builder of the castles
Renews the age-old purpose
And contemplates the milking girl
Whose offer is his need
The young men of the household
Have all gone into service
And are not to be expected
For a year
The innocent young master
Thoughts moving ever faster
Has formed the plan
To change the man he seems
And the poet sheaths his pen
While the soldier lifts his sword

[Refrain 2]
And the oldest of the family
Is moving with authority
Coming from across the sea
He challenges the son
Who puts him to the run

[3. What Do You Do When the Old Man's Gone? / From the Upper Class (10:29 - 15:54)]

[Verse 8]
What do you do when the old man's gone
Do you want to be him?
And your real self sings the song
Do you want to free him?
No one to help you get up steam
And the whirlpool turns you way off-beam

[11:52 - 13:16 - Instrumental]

[Verse 9]
I've come down from the upper class
To mend your rotten ways
My father was a man-of-power
Whom everyone obeyed

[Verse 10]
So come on all you criminals!
I've got to put you straight
Just like I did with my old man
Twenty years too late

[14:00 - 15:26 - Instrumental]

[Verse 11]
Your bread and water's going cold
Your hair is too short and neat
I'll judge you all and make damn sure
That no-one judges me

[4. You Curl Your Toes in Fun / Childhood Heroes / Stabs Instrumental (15:54 - 22:40)]

[Verse 12]
You curl your toes in fun
As you smile at everyone
You meet the stares, you're unaware
That your doings aren't done
And you laugh most ruthlessly
As you tell us what not to be
But how are we supposed to see
Where we should run?

[Verse 13]
I see you shuffle in the courtroom with
Your rings upon your fingers
And your downy little sidies
And your silver-buckle shoes
Playing at the hard case
You follow the example
Of the comic-paper idol
Who lets you bend the rules

[Verse 14]
So, come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books, your super crooks
And show us all the way
Well! Make your will and testament
Won't you join your local government?
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day

[Verse 15]
You put your bet on number one
And it comes up every time
The other kids have all backed down
And they put you first in line
And so you finally ask yourself
Just how big you are
And you take your place in a wiser world
Of bigger motor cars
And you wonder who to call on

[Verse 16]
So! Where the hell was Biggles
When you needed him last Saturday?
And where were all the sportsmen
Who always pulled you though?
They're all resting down in Cornwall
Writing up their memoirs
For a paper-back edition
Of the Boy Scout Manual

[PART TWO]

[5. See There a Man Is Born / Clear White Circles (22:40 - 28:38)]

[Verse 17]
See there! A man is born
And we pronounce him fit for peace
There's a load lifted from his shoulders
With the discovery of his disease
We'll take a child from him
Put it to the test
Teach it to be a wise man
And how to fool the rest

[24:04 - 26:11 - Instrumental]

[Verse 18: Spoken]
We will be geared to the average, rather than the exceptional
God is an overwhelming responsibility
We walked through the maternity ward
And saw 218 babies wearing nylons
It says here that cats are on the upgrade
Upgrade? Hipgrave
Oh, Mac

[Verse 19]
In the clear white circles of morning wonder
I take my place with the lord of the hills
And the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured
In neat little rows sporting canvas frills
With their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention
While queuing for sarnies at the office canteen
Saying: ""How's your granny?"" and good old Ernie
He coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win

[6. Legends and Believe in the Day (28:38 - 35:13)]

[Verse 20]
The legends worded in the ancient tribal hymn
Lie cradled in the seagull's call
And all the promises they made
Are ground beneath the sadist's fall

[Verse 21]
The poet and the wise man stand
Behind the gun, behind the gun
And signal for the crack of dawn
Light the sun, light the sun

[Refrain 3]
Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?

[Verse 22]
The Dawn Creation of the Kings
Has begun, has begun
Soft Venus, lonely maiden brings
The ageless one, the ageless one

[Refrain 3]
Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?

[Verse 23]
The fading hero has returned
To the night, to the night
And fully pregnant with the day
Wise men endorse the poet's sight

[Refrain 3]
Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?

[33:37 - 35:13 - Instrumental]

[7. Tales of Your Life (35:13 - 40:37)]

[Verse 24]
Let me tell you the tales of your life
Of your love and the cut of the knife
The tireless oppression, the wisdom instilled
The desire to kill or be killed
Well, let me sing of the losers who lie
In the street as the last bus goes by
The pavements are empty: the gutters run red
While the fool toasts his god in the sky

[Refrain 4]
So come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear

[Verse 25]
Let me help you pick up your dead
As the sins of the father are fed
With the blood of the fools and the thoughts of the wise and
From the pan under your bed
Well, let me make you a present of song
As the wise man breaks wind and is gone
While the fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose
And the nursery rhyme winds along

[Refrain 4]
So! Come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear
See! The summer lightning casts its bolts upon you
And the hour of judgement draweth near
Would you be the fool stood in his suit of armour
Or the wiser man who rushes clear

Not as long as there are girls like you

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control, I wanna hurt myself

If anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
But you turn your head, and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I lose my head, or I bang it up against a wall

Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
And lock myself up in a padded room

Calling out ""I won't surrender a locket of her hair""

Into the dark again
To feel alive again, and wait for

Or is it me you're after?
Is it time?
Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Real love

Born of the ball and chain
Into a world sustained with sorrow

Real love
A real touch we speak in
Is it lies?
Or is what we're seeking?
Real love
In the eyes, behold and you'll find the 21st century
Detonate her will and her  widowed speech
Buried in the backyard shadow, the rusty coffee tin
That held her mother's first kiss in a nameless dream

Fall down the stairs again
To feel alive against tomorrow

Real love
Or is it me you're after?
Is it time?
Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Is it love?
Or just yours to treasure?
Real love
Real love
Real love

We never listen
Real love will listen
And tell of a fortune
Real love is riches
Scratch through the changes
Real love is nameless
So tired and hopeless
Real love is painless
Nobody mentions
We ever move to collect
The solar questions
Demon scorn should not relax
The laws of gravity

War,rock,Poets of the Fall,2010,"[Verse 1]
Do you remember standing on a broken field
White crippled wings beating the sky
The harbingers of war with their nature revealed
And our chances flowing by

[Pre-Chorus]
If I can let the memory heal
I will remember you with me on that field

[Chorus]
When I thought that I fought this war alone
You were there by my side on the front line
When I thought that I fought without a cause
You gave me a reason to try

Turn the page I need to see something new
For now my innocence is torn
We cannot linger on this stunted view
Like rabid dogs of war

When I thought that I fought this war alone
You were there by my side on the front line
And we fought to believe the impossible
When I thought that I fought this war alone
We were one with our destinies entwined
When I thought that I fought without a cause
You gave me the reason why

With no-one wearing their real face
It's a whiteout of emotion
And I've only got my brittle bones to break the fall
When the love in letters fade
It's like moving in slow motion
And we're already too late if we arrive at all
And then we're caught up in the arms race
An involuntary addiction
And we're shedding every value our mothers taught
So will you please show me your real face
Draw the line in the horizon
'Cause I only need your name to call the reasons why I fought
[Chorus]
When I thought that I fought this war alone
You were there by my side on the front line
And we fought to believe the impossible
When I thought that I fought this war alone
We were one with our destinies entwined
When I thought that I fought without a cause
You gave me the reason why",15662,17793

The Drug in Me Is Reimagined,rock,Falling in Reverse,2020,"[Intro]
I heard a knock upon my door the other day
I opened it to find Death staring in my face
The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates
Everywhere I go, I drag this coffin just in case

My body's trembling sends shivers down my spine
Adrenaline kicks in, shifts into overdrive
Your secrets keep you sick, your lies keep you alive
Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice

I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I’m prayin', ""Feet, don't fail me now""

I lost my goddamn mind, it happens all the time
I can’t believe I'm actually meant to be here
Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

So many things that I would like to understand
If we are born to die and we all die to live
Then what's the point of livin' life if it just contradicts?

A little boy lies asleep in the earth
While down in the valley a cruel war rages
And people forget what a child's life is worth

And waters the grave with its silent tears
While a soldier cleans and polishes a gun
That ended a life at the age of seven years
And the war rages on in the land called ""Somewhere""

And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten

She got soul, soul, soul, sweet soul

Shows me colours when there's none to see
Gives me hope when I can't believe
That for the first time I feel love

I have a brother, when I'm a brother in need
I spend my whole time running
He spends his running after me

I feel myself goin' down
I just call and he comes around
But for the first time I feel love

My father is a rich man, he wears a rich man's cloak
He gave me the keys to his kingdom (coming)
Gave me a cup of gold

He said ""I have many mansions
And there are many rooms to see.""
But I left by the back door
And I threw away the key

We can also think of spectrum of smells, of tactile feelings, of emotions

In which the warps and the loops are all these different spectra; various kinds of vibrations

Hollow Heart,rock,AngelMaker,2019,"It’s always one step forward then it’s two steps back

In my head all I think about is death
My suffering eternal, wounds infernal
Misery keeps calling me, inflicting me, deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper, ecstatically eager
I’m burning my body to set forth the reaper
Suffocate in the black, a sanctitude of sick for me and you
Crippling to the will of hatred
No salvation to run to

We all suffer in a cycle built and bound to claim us all
Scraping through the agony we suffer so religiously
Save me
Devour me alive or just gut me with a knife
Nothing I can do will ever rid you of my life
Every breath is agony, and all I know is

THERE’S NO WAY OUT

It writhes its way in
Left to rot alone again
Shackled by the chains of my own disdain
Misery my company, endless agony consumed by the wounds which inflict me
Of all the wounds that cover me, none of them more burdening
Than the hole in which the pain inside resides eternally
Crawling in my skin
Immeasurable torture

Hollow heart
Sunken and aching empty soul
Devoid of hope
My body is not whole

Death stands in front of me
Ridding me of all I see
No more pain and misery
The reapers gift has set me free
Full of sin
Iʼm pulling back my skin
Tearing out my organs and exposing all the hate I’ve kept within
Creeping, bleeding, seething, weeping
Bury me alive, in a coffin full of knives
Suffocating sickened cycles left me seeking out the scythe
I yearn to feel peace once again

Iʼd rather die than live like this",6774,36299

""Dear Mark, Dear all at Sun Kil Moon
I have really, really, really bad news. We're deeply afraid but see ourselves in circumstances that unfortunately urge us to have to cancel. The Sun Kil Moon show at Dachstock Reitschule, Bern, the open space in front of our house Reitschule, Bern is causing increasing troubles with violence and sexes. An organized drug dealer and the year and months and weeks we decided to shut the place down and its ongoing activities. For a while, at least ten days, or maybe longer and find a way of how to deal with our society's problems erupted in front of our house, creating a rather explosive atmosphere at times in front of our house. We're very sorry that due to this reaction the show with Sun Kil Moon will have to be cancelled. As we're in general enforcing this temporary shutdown, apologies for any inconveniences to you, I know your band just got into town. Of course we're gonna pay full agreed guaranteed fee as well as covering your hotel for 12/7/16. Also tickets will be reimbursed, it can be used to see your show tonight in Zürich. We strongly hope you reschedule your concert in Bern next time your band is touring in Europe. Reitschule remains closed until further notice. Again, my deepest apologies, but it's totally out of my control. Let me know if you need any more info
Sincerely, your promoter at Breathing Hope.""

Near the poster by Picasso?
Do you sleep on the left side or the right?
Would you mind if I leave on the light?
Would you mind if it isn't too bright?
Now I need the window open
So if you happen to get chilly
There's this coverlet
My cousin hand-crocheted
Do you mind if the edges are frayed?
Would you like to unfasten my braid?
Shall I make you in the morning
A cup of home-made coffee?
I will sweeten it with honey and with cream
When you sleep
Do you have dreams?
You can read the early paper
And I can watch you while you shave
Oh God, the mirror's cracked
When you leave
Will you come back?
You don't have to answer that at all
The bathroom door is just across the hall
You'll find an extra towel on the rack
On the paisley-patterned papered wall
There's a comb on the shelf

That wall myself...

Or is it better off in the balance anyway

What the hell you do it's up to you
Now you've got to see it through

Do you make light of a bad situation
By burying your head under the sand
And eat the apple in your eye
Just because your mouth was dry
Oh well

Doesn't really matter what you need
But honesty is paramount
Just tell the man you've had a change of heart

Give someone a answer and they'll think of one
Find yourself somewhere you have never been before

You look the picture of contented new wealth
But from the on-looking fool who believed your lies
I wish this grave would open up and swallow me alive
For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows

When the wheel of fortune broke, you fell to me
Out of grey skies to change my misery
The vacant spot, your beating heart took its place
Now watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room

For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows

The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more ill

The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more ill
Now autumn's breeze blows summer's leaves through my life
Twisted and broken dawn, no days with sunlight
The dying spark, you left your mark on me
The promise of your kiss, but with someone else

For the bitterest pill is mine to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-coloured, mocking shadows

The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill!
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore pain!

Holding a smile like I don't know the story

Buried your worries in bruises and bed sheets

You gave it up to the rape of indifference
Now take those dreams to die

So can you feel it now?
It's just that question of letting the end
Be the answer
Now it's pulling us down
These days become years watching
Time disappear
Again again again
I won't give in

This is...
This is a misfits rejection
Of a life in submission
Your choice
Destroys
What life could be

You just sold out quick
Talk is some cheap shit
Can you remember the last time that your life
Meant more than fucking payments?
Know this, I quit!
Wealth means shit
Tell me what's right
You got the cash
But you're hollow within
So much worse than that mortal sin

This is it
This is my life
You can't buy me

Tell me I'm worthless
Because net worth
Determines a man
I won't give in
When slave wage brings chains made
To keep you conformed 'cause they can
I won't give in

I'll keep on struggling
Because that's the measure of a man

Right?

Your dreams are disavowed
So you must feel it now!

In greed you can drown

And I will still be fighting

But I can't stay that long
No, I've got to meet expenses
I got to stay in line
Gotta get those fees to the agencies
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay
So I just don't have the time
[Verse 5]
I am the entertainer, I come to do my show
You've heard my latest record
It's been on the radio
Ah, it took me years to write it
They were the best years of my life
It was a beautiful song, but it ran too long
If you're gonna have a hit
You gotta make it fit
So they cut it down to 3:05

[Verse 6]
I am the entertainer
The idol of my age
I make all kinds of money
When I go on the stage
Ah, you've seen me in the papers
I've been in the magazines
But if I go cold, I won't get sold
I'll get put in the back in the discount rack
Like another can of beans

[Outro]
I am the entertainer
And I know just where I stand
Another serenader
And another long-haired band
Today, I am your champion
I may have won your hearts
But I know the game and you'll forget my name
I won't be here in another year
If I don't stay on the charts",13202,20691
Start A Fire,rock,Cult to Follow,2017,"Make no mistake, I will wait
Till the end of days‚ separate
Illusion from my conscious state
(You're not safe‚ you're not safe from me)
Clarity‚ deceptive fake
Offering, protection
From god and my hate
(You're not safe, you're not safe from me)

A slave to your delusions becoming evident
Leaving my resolution imminent

Undeserving absolution

Think I'll start a fire
I will burn it down
The house with all the liars
The ones who sold us out
Drowning all these memories drenched in gasoline
Our enemies soaked in glycerin
So we light the match and we run like hell
Run like hell‚ run like hell
So we build a funeral pyre
And start a fire
And here we stand unafraid
Though scars remain, I replace
The victim with mountains of rage
(You're not safe, you're not safe from me)
So I reject forgiveness
Through eyes of innocence
There's no evasion from your consequence

Undeserving absolution

Think I'll start a fire
I will burn it down
The house with all the liars
The ones who sold us out
Drowning all these memories drenched in gasoline
Our enemies soaked in glycerin
So we light the match and we run like hell
Run like hell‚ run like hell
So we build a funeral pyre
And start a fire

And start a fire
And start a fire
And start a fire

Undeserving absolution
Think I'll start a fire
I will burn it down
The house with all the liars
The ones who sold us out
Drowning all these memories drenched in gasoline
Our enemies soaked in glycerin
So we light the match and we run like hell
Run like... run like hell
Run like hell
Start a fire
Run like hell
Start a fire",1190,117837

Six pages down and she's lighting up
Her trainwreck soul

Left by the road
So apalling, scrawling those bullshit words

Just to have a flirt

At one in the morning
Watching the lights flash
In Manhattan
I see five bridges
The Empire State Building
And you said something
That I've never forgotten

Describing the colours
And the smells of our homelands
Acting like lovers
How did we get here?
To this point in living?
I held my breath
And you said something

Riding in your car
Your radio playing

There’s nothing else that I can do
I throw my troubles away
Don’t do nothing I don’t want to

I draw your shadow in my room
I got a lot to take in and nowhere to begin
She told me oh no, don’t you keep me waiting baby
Don’t want to be something if I gotta sell my wounds to you
Dig up a memory I hate
Get some attention when I do
Now everybody knows best
Only see things how they want to
When papers roll in, it doesn’t have to be me
But it will never be you, oh no

Kick me down, mess me up a little more than last timе

In the back of my head
Wherе the devils come play
Nothing better than this
I’m not missing a thing
And if you lay me down
Just let me burn instead
And if I get knocked down
I don’t want to go back

In the back of my head
Where the devils come play
Nothing better than this
I’m not missing a thing
In the house that I live
Where I spend all my days
Nothing better than this
I don’t miss anything",7534,33297

You silence for your confidence

Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take? Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Saving all your yawns in a jar
No one has to know, sprinkled all of your cologne

Trading all of your friends for a pot, for a pot of gold

You always go away)

And ventricles pumping, working overtime
Our freedoms fraught with danger being circumscribed
A life cut short and circumcised
A rubble of commandments from the road, step aside
A rubble of commandments in the road, step aside

Mister trouble, come walkin' this way
Year gone past feels like one long day
But I'm alive and I'm feelin' all right
Well, I run that hard road outta Heartbreak City
Built a roadside carnival out of hurt and self-pity
It was all wrong, well now I'm movin' on

Ain't no flags unfurled
Just me and you and the love we're bringing

I built a shrine in my heart, it wasn't pretty to see
Made out of fool's gold, memory, and tears cried

I still got a little faith, but what I need is some proof tonight
I'm lookin' for it in your eyes

It's ours tonight and we're going with the tumblin' dice

The Loophole,rock,Garfunkel & Oates,2015,"[Verse 1]
All my life I've been good
Do what my mom and dad and God say I should
Go to church and Bible School
To live by God's rule
So whatever people tell me
That the Bible tells me
I will do
Walk the halls of high school with my purity ring
Unlike those other girls, I got my morals in check
It was easy to do 'til I got a boyfriend
And pardon my French, but he's cute as heck
But I made a pact to keep my hymen intact
And Jesus and I are tight
Never learned about the birds and the bees
I was taught to keep an aspirin in-between my knees
'Cause The Bible says premarital sex is wrong
But Jason says that guys can't wait that long
I don't wanna lose him to someone who'll do him
I need to figure something out
Well, there's a loophole in The Scripture that works really well
So I can get him off without going to hell
It's my Hail Mary, full of grace
In Jesus' name, we go to fifth base
Oh, thank you for making me holy
And thank you for giving me holes to choose from
And since I'm not a godless whore
He'll have to come in the back door, therefore
[Chorus]
Fuck me in the ass, 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of a throbbing rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex
That God can't see

[Verse 2]
It's hard to be as pure as me
To resist the urge to lose my vaginal virginity
To wait until my marriage bed
To give my husband my unsullied maidenhead
So take your cock out, shove it in my ass
Fuck me until you cum, oops! I mean
Let's join our souls and unite our bodies
And fly with the wings of God
Whatever you do, don't touch my clitoris
If you ring Satan's doorbell, God can't ignore this
And no prophylactics when you put it in
'Cause birth control's for sluts and it's a sin
I've emptied my bowels and laid out the towels
I'm ready for romance
Now I'm praying to the Power that's the Highest
But of all of my holes, this one's the driest
And we can't procreate if we anally copulate
And God's okay with sodomy, but only if you're straight
And I'm staying pure, no matter what
So I'm okay with everything, but... everything, but...
Everything butt... (Woah)
[Chorus]
Fuck me in the ass, 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of a rock hard rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex
That God can't see

[Bridge]
I do whatever The Bible tells me to
Except for the parts that I choose to ignore
'Cause they're unrealistic and inconvenient
But the rest I live by for sure
So let's not talk about how the Good Book bans shellfish, polyester and divorce
And how it condones slavery and killing gays, 'cause those parts don't count, of course
Let's cherry-pick the part about losing my cherry and mine it for ambiguities and omissions
To circumvent any real sacrifice, but still feel pious in my arbitrary parroted positions
And don't you dare question my convictions
And don't look closely at the contradictions
Just focus on the sacrificial crucifixion
And have faith in its complete jurisdiction
As the only way to measure if you're good or not
And in a debate, just say to “have faith”
'Cause when up against logic, it's the only card you've got
So close your eyes
Take a deep breath, and
[Chorus]
Fuck me in the ass, 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of an irrational rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex
That God can't see

I'll be drifting along
The woman I'm a-loving, she rules my heart
No knife could ever cut our love apart

Catch the breeze to find better days

Drive straight to Tempe to see about
About a brand new life, maybe a fresh start
A brighter light out in the desert
Hoping a late night drive will help me clear my mind

She prayed for his attention, often on repeat

He was in denial in his own backyard
Pleading for the rain just to come down hard
She bought him a bracelet and put it on his wrist
Like every time before she got close but missed

Beating like a drum in a hard luck space

Keeping all the angels under her command
He saw every detail burning like sun
Couldn't get it straight that his race was run

Good Morning Magpie,rock,Murder by Death,2010,"A seam across the sky

The sky is filling
With flocks and swarms
They burst through the branches
They tumble and fall
Little gods surveying their worlds
Examining it all

My wings are dusted
With frost and cold
For a little thing like you
I'm too heavy a load
You'll struggle and falter
Amble around
Just follow some other storm
Cause I'll only weigh you down

You carry me home
My love
Still you carry me home
Little dove
A change in the winds
Smoke on the breeze
The sky is filled
With the scent of burning leaves
The vapors rise
From the glen in the east
Where the path is clear for you and me

You carry me home
My love
Still you carry me home
Little dove

You'll ride towards the sun
As it guides you home
But don't be afraid,little bird
You aren't alone
A hoard of friends
Will keep darkness at bay
You're the needle
In the hay

I'll take you with a steady hand
Make the seam reborn
The rip will be sewn up again
By the same hand that had it torn
You carry me home
My love
Still you carry me home
Little dove
Still you carry me home
My love
Still you carry me home

The shuffle of feet
The clamor of metal
And hounds in heat

Hey now, little speedyhead
The read on the speed-meter says
You have to go to task in the city
Where people drown and people serve
Don't be shy, you're just dessert
Is only just light years to go

[Chorus 1]
Me, my thoughts are flower strewn
With ocean storm, bayberry moon
I have got to leave to find my way
Watch the road and memorize
This life that passed before my eyes
And nothing is going my way

[Verse 2]
The ocean is the river's goal
A need to leave the water knows
We're closer now than light years to go
[Chorus 2]
I have got to find the river
Bergamot and vetiver
Run through my head and fall away
Leave the road and memorize
This life that passed before my eyes
And nothing is going my way

[Verse 3]
There's no one left to take the lead
But I tell you and you can see
We're closer now than light years to go
Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
Fall into the ocean

[Chorus 3]
The river to the ocean goes
A fortune for the undertow
None of this is going my way
There is nothing left to throw
Of Ginger, lemon, indigo
Coriander stem and rose of hay

Strength and courage overrides
The privileged and weary eyes
Of river poet search naiveté
Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
All of this is coming your way",35184,8242

Built to spill, you're state of the art

Russian Roulette,rock,Accept,1986,"I know you raped me
And fucked my soul and life
You screwed my brain
And offered me a line

You set my heart on fire
To make me stick like glue
You know I'm coming
Down to the point of fear

You make me eat myself
In scream in pain in vain
To lose the last bit of identity
And forget humanity

That's what you like to do
To treat a man like a pig
And when I'm dead and gone
It's an award I've won

Pays for my life
Which I give now when I die

I feel there's the water, should I sink or dive?
An empty plate, fill up my sentimental morning stars

But, oh, she lives in Oklahoma City, far away from me
Well, there's an empty hope chest, I quit the dope quest
And remain independently happy

May seem somewhat unrehearsed

And I'll be back to my normal self

Enter the Exterminator,rock,Foetus,1985,"(Terminate, terminate, terminate)

The waiting becomes torture, distractions become bliss
Futility's a luxury when you sleep in blood, sperm, vomit, and piss
Huddling to the dead for support, jacking off for warmth
Swaddled in less than ashes and rags
The payoff's always been over the ridge
And the pot of gold is full of shit
Now hi-ho, hi-ho it's off to work we go
Another merry go-down go-down go-down
Go-down go-down go-down go-down

I seen a prisoner without her clothes
Living on a diet of dirt and water
Being slapped and sliced because
She didn't happen to agree with the warden
He had an itchy trigger finger

Jackboots battering a tattoo on the inside of my skull
Militantly hankering for something never done
High school memories, once a folly
Are now reality due to sheer lack of present
Death without a trial, dyin' ain't a trial
Dyin' ain't a curse but livin' sure is worse
Each experience becomes my epilogue
Countin' my ribs for the thousandth time
Dyin' on a diet of gruel and grime
They fall down, they don't rise again
Where the women are trodden and forgotten are men
They're givin' birth to orphans
Black Jew glue
The air is old, the comments are cold
I'm covered in lice and scabs and mold
My days are numbered, I'm in a daze
The door creaks open, the whole room prays
Enter the exterminator
Enter the exterminator

I hear the sweet sound of syringes
Crushed underfoot
See who set the home fires burnin'
See who set the husbands burnin'
Make the accusation stick
Morale is thin, the air is thick
Hard earned self-esteem goes up in a puff of smoke
I'm waitin' to die
I'm waitin' to die
To much of a coward to snuff myself
Guess I'll just have to suffer myself

Countin' my ribs for the thousandth time
Dyin' on a diet of gruel and grime
They fall down, they don't rise again
Where the women are trodden and forgotten are men
They're givin' birth to orphans

And I can't show my love, and I can't stop it
Oh, I can't stop it

There's a house there, somebody's waiting
Somebody else's arms will wrap around him
And in that moment, what will he think then
When I can't touch him

[Chorus: Stevie Nicks & Natalie Maines]
Maybe my love could fly over the ocean
Maybe my heart should try to leave him alone
All that I really know is that he's goin'
Too far from Texas
Too close to home

In a room just outside of Houston
That's where I spend my nights, trying to get through to him
He says he's comin' back in every letter
But he might never
No he might never

Maybe my love could fly over the ocean
Maybe my heart should try to leave him alone
All that I really know is that he's goin'
Too far from Texas
Too close to home

Does he know how long
I've waited for this love to come
Does he know I'm holdin' on
And that won't change no matter where he's gone

Maybe my love could fly over the ocean
Maybe my heart should try to leave him alone

Those Dumb Punk Kids Will Buy Anything,rock,Jello Biafra,2005,"Punk's been dumbed down to just another form of TV
Marketed to shoppers spoonfed cartoon rebellion like sheep
Flock to worship any old school band
Who cares if they still care or if they're bad
Something new in town who wants to know?
And look at all the whores reunions for wrong reasons
Playing only songs from the good old days
About how bad the good old days were
So why not us? We don't even like this stuff no more
But look at all that retro-racket cash
Those dumb punk kids will buy anything
We'll sue the guy who wrote the songs
So we can sell them into commercials
Steal the name and hit the road trashing all our band stood for
We won't rehearse, sound worse
Dig up some old child star Who never learns the words
Hey, we're back Show us how much you care
The merch booth's right over there
And if our scam works What a bandwagon it will be
Malcolm in the Middle in the Misfits or Mary Kate and Ashley
Gary Coleman in Black Flag Courtney in Nirvana at last
And Emmanuel Lewis back in action singing for the Germs
When will it end? When people see this for what it is
Rock and Roll Swindle Pistols backed a thief
So how bout Kenny Boy Lay In Dead Kennedys
Because those dumb punk kids will buy anything",1614,98677

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me
Oh somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?",6056,39651

Me vs Maradona vs Elvis,rock,Brand New,2013,"With one or two, I get used to the room
We go slow when we first make our moves
By five or six, bring you out to the car
Number nine with my head on the bar
And it's sad but true, out of cash and IOUs

I got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
Bring you back to the bar, get you out of the cold
My sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
Who they'll kiss before they get home

[Chorus]
I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say

Barely conscious in the door where you stand
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
And your hair smells of smoke
Who will cast the first stone?
You can sin or spend the night all alone
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
If you let me have my way, I swear, I'll tear you apart

Cause it's all you can be
You're a drunk, and you're scared
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free

I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say

There I will be, with my arms spread out and broken
Waiting for your breath, to animate my veins

I need to try to find a way to fix my head
And not be so damn self-obsessed
To learn to like to be myself
And not rely on someone else
To care not for fears and not for doubts
And just for those I care about
To try because I want to try
And not to try for only I, oh
I wait for something to change
Maybe what should change is really me

Now I can see why I was cast aside
You'll all have a better love, you'll all have a better life

Pick up the phone, answer your text
Well, I apologize about last night, I really did not mean to disrespect
You, you better be alone, no, I'm not obsessed
But if I catch you with somebody else, you know that I am gonna be upset
I truly believe that the reason I'm here
Is to tell you the truth that your ending is near
And one day you must look at yourself in the mirror
I still don't think that you are hearing me clear
You must understand that our friendship is done
Justified by the person that you have become
But because of the fact that enough is enough
Now I'm the one that is holding the gun

Whoa, this will be the end of us
I have tried way too many times to heal
I have loved you so much, it hurts me, dear

Pick yourself up, up off the floor
Wipe the tears from off your face because the cops are knocking on the door
They're gonna wanna know what's up, better tell them that you fell
'Cause when they see the bruises on my face, they're probably taking both of us to jail
I'm sick and tired of fighting each other
The lying, the crying, the calling your mother
The calling of names, I'm bothered and smothered
We kiss and make up and get under the covers
A dangerous cycle I don't understand
The kicking, the screaming, the breaking of lamps
I'll be damned if I see you with some other man
'Cause if I cannot have you, then nobody can

Hope you come down with something they can't diagnose
Don't have the cure for

We are entirely smooth
We admit to the truth
We are the best at what we do

This is the way you wish your voice sounds
Handsome and smart
Oh, my tongue's the only muscle on my body
That works harder than my heart

And it's all from watching TV
And from speeding up my breathing
Wouldn't stop if I could
Oh, it hurts to be this good

You're holding on to your grudge
Oh, it hurts to always have to be
Honest with the one that you love
Oh, so let it go

This is the price you pay for loss of control
This is the break in the bend
This is the closest of calls
This is the reason you're alone
This is the rise and the fall!

O say goodbye to the little girl tree
O you know that I must say goodbye
To the little girl tree
This wall I built around you
Is made out of stone-lies
O little girl the truth would be
An axe in thee
O father look to your daughter
Brick of grief and stricken morter
With this ring
This silver hoop of wire
I bind your maiden mainstem
Just to keep you as a child

[Verse 2]
O say goodbye to the little girl tree
O you know that I must say goodbye
To my little girl tree
How fast your candy bones
Reached out for me
I must say goodbye to your brittle bones
Crying out for me
O you know that I must say goodbye
O goodbye
Even though you will betray me
The very minute that I leave
[Verse 3]
O say goodbye to the little girl tree
O Lord you know that I must say goodbye
To that little girl tree
I rise up her girl-child lumps and slipping knots
Into her laden boughs
And amongst her roping limbs
Like a swollen neck vein branching
Into smaller lesser veins
That must all just sing and say goodbye
And let her blossom veils fly
Her velvet gown
Down down down
Down down down
Down down down and goodbye
For you know that I must say goodbye

[Verse 4]
To a rhythm softly tortured
Of a motion back and forth
That's a rhythm sweetly tortured
O that's the rhythm of the orchard
And you know that I must say goodbye
To that little girl tree

Yes goodbye

Down down down
Down down down
Down down down and goodbye

You pushed my head under the water
I lost my breath, but the skyline called my name

The wilds the wilds the wilds they pull you in
These miles we've walked and miles we talked have been
The first time I am not alone in my head
By itself, oneself, can't find where it began
The dust you'll find beneath my feet
Reminds me of the simpler things
When it was only you and me
But now I see, now I see

So we all fall asleep
So we laugh and play
So we drink and eat
So we count our time
So we know our keep
But it floats away
Nothing seems to stay these days
Fragile and weak
It's been years and now
I get a moment to speak
And all I think about
Is what to say
When you're, face to face with nothing
And nothing will escape your lips

The clouds, the clouds, the clouds
They take their shape
We dream that in their billows
Are answers to this place
You ask me to surrender
You're sure it's what I'll take

And cursed it at the gates

My mother's oldest one

'cept cows and a few raccoons

I was drivin' around in my shoebox car
My baby and me underneath the stars
My engine was knockin'
But i knew it'd clear real soon

I was cruisin' along 'bout 95
I looked in my mirror and man alive
Some guy was gaining on me
As his engine roared

So i gave that Holly carb some gas
My baby cried out don't let him pass
I guess it's just that bitch got bored
I had to race my fucked up Ford

I made the turn at 108
And he was up on my back gate
And I knew he had something bad
Underneath that hood
So I pushed it up to 110
That flathead motor was about to give in
I crossed my fingers and prayed to the lord
Don't let me down you fucked up Ford

It's my fucked up Ford!
It's my fucked up Ford!

When cherry tops began to spin
I knew this race was about to end
It's a cop by god
My engine can't give no more

He threw me in jail, warrant ignored
My car blew up as the oil poured
I guess it's just that bitch got bored
I had to race my fucked up Ford

It's my fucked up Ford! Whoooo!
It's my fucked up Ford!",2999,66291

Surely, somehow
This will be alright

My good faith, might go far, to a place a little indisposed
It's me and me and me and me and me and you
You you you you you, will you stay
Without the sight of what to do
Don’t gotta rush it

I wanna hold you back
I want to hold you back from them
It's like you took the bad
And never looked back from there

Please don't let your heart get bruised
Feel what you never felt before
Stay true to the sounds you use to know
I'm betting this gets better
Feel free while you close yourself
Off from your belated after thoughts
Kneel when you ought to show some faith

Just be my lover like this

It's just the way I got sick

Cheeks so pale they could fade away

None sweeter to the taste
Flagellate the liar

You were indeed, we rats have seen

Fell vacant at your feet
Did your god he cough into his sleeve

The guilt, how it hangs
Like chains, an albatross of shame
Smell the reek of lie
The dawn at which you'll die has come today
These walls don't talk
But we hear most everything
When your hand covered their mouths
Your ecstasy, their stifled screams
No truth so fucking vile
As the one you must face

When the silken robes of sodomy
Fell vacant at your feet
Did your god he cough into his sleeve
Did he toast with you

So fleeting and so sweet?

Devour in frenzy this unsacred flesh
We gorge at the raped ones' behest

And Pearl Jam Ten on the wall
Just what did it take
To trigger the end
Too many trips to the bowl and the bond fire mask watched our friends go one by one
I stood with you through how it feels to be something on
Time played my favorite song

Said you wish I was older

I believe in the way you call to me

Singing out in broken revelry

Hey! It’s hard for me to just be your friend

That I can’t explain away

That I probably shouldn’t take
But I say them anyway
You’re killing me with chemistry

You had love for the mix tape
With your feet on the dashboard of my car
Said you couldn’t remember
The last time you heard your favorite song
Sang it out for the sinners
Slowly passing by out on the road
With your hand on my hand
Said “I know a place that we can go.”

Give me an instance of one night that we've spent alone

One More Night,rock,Fucked Up,2011,"I've spent too much of my life defending my past
Can't find power in truth when it never lasts
Never said I was a hero, just I been miscast

Throughout all of the stress of being accused
My defenses replaced the love that we knew
I never got the chance just to miss you

I'd go through it again, I would embrace the pain
If it gave me the chance for just one glance
Of you in my arms to hold in my dreams

It's too hard to ever let you go
I may be alone now but I'll always know
You'll never be gone just as long as I keep
What memories we made when we were in love

I'd give into the lie to keep your memory alive
I know tryin' to forget you's my only crime
I never want to be right I just want to say goodbye
So take my sight, the wind in my hair
Take my touch, I know she's still there
In songs of birds just as long as they're words
I remember her taste, the sun on my face
So strip me away, I don't want to be real
I want to float through this peace that I feel
The memories stay like a seed in the rain
I'll nurture our love and live through it again
She's alive in my head so I'll live there instead
And remember our love

(Do all words can do, David I still love you
I want you to grow but never let me go
I'll be a seed in your heart
I'll be with you when you start
To turn and hum again
I'll be a part of your love
Your life will sprout like a tree
And all the leaves will be me
And all the fruit will glow just to let you know
That I loved you the best, now I can rest)

I felt your hair on my chest as your heart came to rest
It's tempo tied to the spin of the world I lived in
Maybe I won't say goodbye, pretend you never died
But I couldn't live in a world I didn't forgive
You know if I could, I'd carve myself out of wood
Paint over my scars and wish upon a star
I watched that sun as it drowned and rise again from the ground
In its perennial grace I see your shining face
Now that you've gone away, I can finally say
That if you were here today I'd love you the same way
It all happened before and it'll happen again
When you realize the end is the same place you began
I rest my case on my heart, I'm sick of playing the part
I don't want to be right, just one more night
I don't want to be right, just one more night
I don't want to be right, just one more night
I don't want to be right, just one more night

Here from my side of my water of my blue screen blues
There's a path headed out to the bright lights
And a myriad of sways
And no dice for the radio silence
On our pirated waves

I'm a far-and-away-now vagrant
I'm drifted off coast
Settled in to a concrete rhythm
Beating slowly and close

And in the hands of a foreign danger
And in the enemy’s fire
As close as you've come to living
In a long long time

But I dreamed of voices
They were calling out to you
""Come alive, come alive in the fire""
I swear everything's true
Everything is true

Sleep now on the bed that so evades my breath
Don't dream of the days we’re given up
Through the night's unslept

Come and dance by the armoured soldiers for the menace of peace
Come and stand by the ghetto blasters playing
""fuck tha police""

And the end of our rope
In a way this lonesome chasm makes us
Holy and close
If there's a fight in the batting cages
For the rest of our time

Avert your eyes if everything we love we lose

In life, place your bets, take it easy when you fold
How many lives have you bent?
One's plenty broken and stole

Yes, it's true, pull the trigger, I'm a bad man from the start
It don't hurt to see, I snigger and don't care, pull me off

Yes, I've read your mind's acquitted, you want it all

Lord Protect My Child,rock,Bob Dylan,1983,"[Verse 1]
For his age, he’s wise
He’s got his mother’s eyes
There’s gladness in his heart
He’s young and he’s wild
My only prayer is, if I can’t be there
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 2]
As his youth now unfolds
He is centuries old
Just to see him at play makes me smile
No matter what happens to me
No matter what my destiny
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 3]
The whole world is asleep
You can look at it and weep
Few things you find are worthwhile
And though I don’t ask for much
No material things to touch
Lord, protect my child
[Verse 4]
He’s young and on fire
Full of hope and desire
In a world that’s been raped and defiled
If I fall along the way
And can’t see another day
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 5]
There’ll be a time I hear tell
When all will be well
When God and man will be reconciled
But until men lose their chains
And righteousness reigns
Lord, protect my child",2159,82569

Of blood and abhorrence

So This Is My Future,rock,Ice Nine Kills,2010,"If they mean nothing let them go
I can't remember what it feels like on my own
I say nothing to prove they have capacity to
Love anything but themselves

But I believe in dinosaurs because I've seen their bones
Keep digging for the skulls of good intentions and a selfless corpse
That reeks of honest efforts to make things work

Lost forever are our former selves
Can you show me proof they ever lived
Or are they tainted memories of a wishful mind
That's looking for a reason to forgive

If they mean nothing let them go
Are those hands around the shoulders or the throat?
Or maybe a bit of both?

Try not to cringe at the applause of the opposition
You're twice the fool and half the liar
And they're on to you
I say nothing to prove they have capacity to
Love anything but themselves

Lost forever are our former selves
Can you show me proof they ever lived
Or are they tainted memories of a wishful mind
That's looking for a reason to forgive

And I keep digging, a search for peace
It's just a shell with nothing underneath
But I believe in dinosaurs because I've seen their bones (And I keep digging, a search for peace)
So maybe buried evidence will tell me what I've always known (It's just a shell with nothing underneath)

If they mean nothing let them go
Between the good and bad I'm stuck with what I know

Lost forever are our former selves

As long as you still want me to
Can't stand this place
Is there anything here left for me, beside your face?
It's the only thing that's keeping me here

Say what you want
We never talk about things
You never let me in

The Straight-Razor Cabaret,rock,Aurelio Voltaire,2011,"In a cafe
On the Champs-Élysées
I saw a girl the other day
I was beguiled
'till i saw her smile
It was a gash across her face

Not long ago she found that she was alone
So she wandered into a vaudeville show
She should have known it'd be bad
She saw the name that it had: The Straight Razor Cabaret
The first act was a stripper
And the host looked like Jack the Ripper
But the audience was dreary
And so he slashed them smiles from ear to ear

He used a straight-razor
Cause he's a face raper
And there's nothing he hates more than a stick in the mud
If he tells a joke
You better laugh until you choke
At the Straight Razor Cabaret
When i flew down to Camden town
I saw a man reading the Bible
I won't in haste describe his face
For i might be sued for libel

Not long ago he found that he was alone
So he wandered into a vaudeville show
He should have known he'd be maimed
When he discovered the name:
The straight razor cabaret
While the strumpet stroked a Donkey
The host juggled five dead monkeys
But the audience were snobs
So he took a knife right to their gobs

He used a straight-razor
Cause he's a face raper
And there's nothing he hates more than a stick in the mud
If he does a trick
You better laugh until you're sick
At the Straight Razor Cabaret

La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La

They call him straight-razor
Cause he's a face raper
And there's nothing he hates more than a stick in the mud
If he pulls a gaffe you bloody up and laugh!
It's the Straight Razor Cabaret!
It's the Straight Razor Cabaret!
It's the Straight Razor Caba-

I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

[Verse 2]
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
""Please, can I call you her name?""

And I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
""No, you can't call me her name""

Tell me, where's your hiding place?
I'm worried I'll forget your face

You can call me anything you want""",338348,506

How nobody knows, nobody knows my pain

Same Shade as Concrete,rock,Circle Takes the Square,2004,"Rejoice, rejoice a noble birth
A prince is born
Behold the birth of violence
Beasts of fang and feather cry for our concrete rapture
And if we beg to be put down

Unto us the most inspired storm
A princess ravaged by her prince
Behold the birth of sex and distance
Two frail corpses both were they
His eyes were the first to stray

Every tree held fastened earth to sky
Concrete replaces every branch and twig as they were frayed
Upon the birth of ambition
The heavens filled our gilded vessel with poison tears
Before we drink, I propose a toast, a final prayer
Here's to the watchers in the wood, here's to the last days
Unto us a most inspired song

Shaper, stop the music
Halt the harp strings whose chords confuse our histories with textures
With the disheartened chorus of a hymnal whose choir is the conviction of the starving, artless
Tempted by the feast of proof
That this body, that this body of work has worth
Uncertain as the fingering
Of a chord torn prematurely from a piano's womb
As we fill our precious lungs with concrete, that faithful shade
A shaper's song is stopped short
A final breath, a sinking shore
Then the only movement and the last remains of grace
Pollen falling off the simple hinge joint leg upon the final breath of a dragonfly
A cardinal, lost but headstrong in mid flight cries for our concrete rapture

Wade in the water, wade

Wade in the water
Wade in the water, child
(Let the flood swell)

Let the flood swell

Thank the storm for her tears
The faithful say its beautiful, its god's will
But the fool knows what the prophets have seen
No salvation's impending
The faithful say its beautiful
Its god's will let the flood swell and the bodies that break
We'll just float down the river

Stay tame, soft river
While we weigh our faith, stay sweet
Run softly, sweet river
The fool who wades in doubt will float like concrete
Come and, come and fill your lungs

There's so much hope buried underneath
There's so much hope buried underneath
There's so much hope buried underneath tragedy
It's the same shade as concrete

The faithful say its beautiful
Its god's will, let the flood swell
On the loudspeaker sermons and a parish descending
There's so much hope buried underneath tragedy
It's the same shade as concrete

Let the flood swell",4691,48174

Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station

As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes

Spitting out the beer then growing my hair then to finding Alcapulco gold

Into the, ozone layer, introduced to some, powder dumping into my system
Working at bookstores With never showering
Yellow pit stains dance music war stories on, tape
Enter here, follow signs to down hill, take caution, leave behind all your sexual,powers, Apocalypse, night has, no mercy, all the buds are
Bastards when they choose to, overlook, and eliminate your, fantasy tonight

And so it begins
Here we are...
In this dark reminder
If you were wise, you'd step away
As I would like to begin
My ascension!

Relive the dark times
Living your mind in decline
For every part that's missing
You will surely be mine
What can we use?
There is nothing to lose
But when the timer starts ticking
You won't survive
Bring me to life!

Telling you your choices
I'm telling you that
Running ain't a choice
For a cold, dead parasite!

Look beneath and you'll find my demeanor
Swallowed by a monster
Trapped within a blunder
I'm telling you that
Hiding ain't a choice
For a cold, dead parasite!

[Verse 2]
Beware of the wires
It can't be helped
I'm falling apart
A whole infestation awaits
I witnessed more than you in this corruption!

So if you're late
I would hate to parade your mistake
If you react a little slower
Death will be higher made!
We were devoured by a suit from Hell
And if you know what's good for you
Then you'll comply as you bring me to life!

Hold on!
Never hold on!

Darkness is born!
Terror evolves!

You're tied up in chains!
THERE'S NO MORE TIME!
You'll be burned alive just like old times!
No more nights!
You're full of fright!
Your blood is theirs, and they are you!

Accommodate,rock,Frankie Cosmos,2018,"Found myself in a scene
Told my friends how you made me
They let you stomp in still
Kept you around against my will

No one will listen, no one will talk
I had to leave just to hear my thoughts

My body is a burden
I’m always yearning
To be less accommodating
To say loud how I’m feeling

A brief breath of safety
Disturbed by a series of break-ins
Spills out brain onto the plate and
Serves to host but one party

Where the air hits invisible
A spot so thin it’s miserable
Tries to carve a place to escape
But holes out in a wholly unholy place
You could hardly hear them crack
Crashed down onto concrete so vast",3055,65446

If I would’ve known, I’d be here today
There are so many things, I’d go back and change
If I would’ve known, I’d be here today
I’d be here today

[Verse 2]
Still it’s hard for me to look at a picture of you
Knowing that I missed that chance, to tell you I loved you again
This life is so desolate without you here
I would’ve thought by now, I’d run out of tears, out of tears

If I would’ve known, we wouldn’t have tomorrow

Love is easy
Whichever way you start
Taking a diamond
Slice it through your heart
And watch what color bleeds
Task which sweetness
Decimation stings

For valentine and twinning flame
On whiff of pain and cross
Your cedar burns, aflame

And cursed tower
Masts blacked windswept
Horizons ever sour
If it takes more to find you
Than setting out a faded sun

Do the stars inked on my face
State what's changed?
With a distance I can't make
From a distance I can't make

For anguished scrive and maelstrom mouse

Nightfall,rock,Blind Guardian,1998,"No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
All hope's lost, it cannot be undone
They're wasted and gone

Save me your speeches, I know
(They blinded us all)
What you want, you will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in is gone forever more

Like sorrowful seagulls they sang
Lost in the deep shades the misty cloud brought
(A wailing when beauty was gone, come take a look at the sky)
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony

How long shall we mourn in the dark
The bliss and the beauty will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be
But even in silence, I heard the words
An oath we shall swear by the name of the one till the world's end
(Just wondering how I can still hear these voices inside)
It can't be broken
The doom of the Noldor drew near

The words of a banished king
I swear revenge
Filled with anger, aflamed our hearts
Full of hate, full of pride
Oh we screamed for revenge

Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
Vala he is, that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
(But freely you came and
You freely shall depart)
Never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends

Oh I'm heir of the high lord
You better not trust him
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind
And finally you may follow me
Farewell, he said

Quietly it crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly it crept in and changed us all

Immortal land lies down in agony

The Trouble With Tribbles,rock,Aurelio Voltaire,2012,"Well i worked on a garbage Scowl near the Neutral-Zone
And i'm sure you've heard what occurs when a fellow is alone
Well i was mighty lonely there 'till i met a man named Jones
But he sold me a muff, covered in fluff, so i wouldn't have to spank my bone!

So grab yourself a Tribble and then you're good to go
If you've got enough? quadrotriticale you'll have an endless supply of ho's!
I grabbed myself some Vaseline and slathered up my pole
But the trouble with these tribbles: They're fuzzy and their cute but i can never find the hole
They're fuzzy and they're cute but he can never find the hole!

Well that mate there is Scotty. He's our chief engineer
And he's never had a ho, 'cause most dont know: He's queer as Vulcan beer
I caught him with some tribbles i said ""Man, are you dumb!?
Hear my song: You're doing it wrong!"" he was shovin' them up his bum

So grab yourself a Tribble and then you're good to go

But the trouble with these tribbles: They're fuzzy and their cute but i can never find the hole
They're fuzzy and they're cute but he can never find the hole!
Klingon Captain Koloth he's mean as he is shrewd
And on shore leave, he got us peeved because he's very rude
We beamed all of our tribbles to Koloth and his crew
But from the yells we couldn't tell just who was raping who

So grab yourself a Tribble and then you're good to go
If you've got enough? quadrotriticale you'll have an endless supply of ho's!

Bones says these critters are all pregnant when they're born
I had just 1 now i have 1,000 maybe more
I got so many now i know just what to do
I think i'll start an interstellar heavy petting zoo! Haha!

I was on K7 when i saw Mr. Jones
And i gave him what-for and said what's more
""I'm here to pick a bone!""
That tribble that you sold me: it didn't have a hole to screw!
""You dope!"" he said ""You dont screw them!
You let those things screw you!""

So grab yourself a Tribble and then you're good to go
If you've got enough? quadrotriticale you'll have a dozen of them in your hole!
I grabbed myself some Vaseline and slathered up my rump
'cause the nice thing about these tribbles: They're fuzzy and they're cute and you can put them in your bum
They're fuzzy and they're cute and he can put them in his bum
So go back to your quarters and on your bunk you lay
Ya hope and pray that on our way we pass a bird of prey
The tribbles hate the Klingons: They really make them go
They get irate, then they vibrate up in your Heiney hole!

Song to Hall Up High,rock,Bathory,1990,"I know you watch over me
Father of all the past
And all that will ever be
You are the first and the last

The watcher of all that lives
The guardian of all that died

The one-eyed God way up high
Who rules my world and the sky

Northern wind take my song up high
To the Hall of glory in the sky
So its gates shall greet me open wide
When my time has come to die",5539,42498
Stress Builds Character,rock,Dystopia,1994,"[Intro]
Y'know sometimes, sometimes I feel so tired
I can't eat I can't sleep
So tired
The pressure builds and builds
Seems like there's no release
The things I see go unnoticed by some
But fill my eyes with horror
Anger, and guilt, and frustration, and depression
Makes waking up every day harder and harder
I work my fingers to the bone just to survive
I gotta get money so I can have a home
So I can breathe, eat and live in this society
I don't even like money
And I gotta work every day just to feed myself
God it makes me sick
I just wanna curl up into a hole and die
This... this isn't worth it!
I need a raise man!
I can't survive on this pay anymore!
I can't live on this!
I'm hungry, and I'm frustrated
And I can't eat, dammit!
God! I look for you to help, and I don't see no help
And I see no thoughts, no looks, no praise!
You don't care, you don't love me!
I only love myself
No one will love me like I love me
[main song]
Life's been swell now I want to die
My body, it hurts me, sigh after sigh
I call it torture, you call it life
A slave to money and everything I despise
Like everyone in general
Fuck, eat, sleep, destroy
Just about the only things you fucking enjoy
I am a disposable being who will fuck all life
I multiply and the air gets thinner and dirty
I take up space, I smell, I consume
But I produce nothing, I abuse
I have no reason to exist
The toilet's clogged in this world of shit

I breathe filth everyday
Living fucks up my brain
Why? Why did I wake up today?
My eyes are heavy
Why? Why must I see this face?
Your life is ugly
Why? Why must I buy these things?
I don't want them

Frustration. Alone
Tension. Despair. Tension

And I die trying just to keep myself from kissing you
You take in everything with a certainty I envy
It's somehow all I need
Just keep me guessing, please

Mean much more to me than anything

I listened closely ‘cause you could not lie
All the whispers come to my address

My face is in the dust, and you know I must pretend
But I’m feeling slowly overwhelmed
And you know I must believe all the words I didn’t hear

You’ve been calling me all night long
You kept calling ‘till I lost my phone
Though I’ve been telling you, my secrets end with lies

I’m just so tired, could it be much worse?
We have tried but we failed to loosen up

Always in my dreams you are
I got your voice on tape
I got your spirit in a photograph
Always out of reach you are

Cold inside my arms you are
Simple like a child you are
I remember when you took my hand and led me through the rain
Down inside my soul you are

The more I show the way I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent, forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Well think again

Mother lost her looks for you
Father never wanted you
I trust to love and then I find you never really felt the same
There's something in your heart so cruel
The more I show the way I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent, forgot to mention we're good friends

The Angst in My Veins,rock,Capsize,2014,"Have you ever felt like you were invisible?
And tell me now if you've ever felt miserable
There's never really been a clear explanation
To live your life opposite to the world's rotation
To feel like no one. ""No one understands.""
To feel like you could die another lonely man
And I am tired of hearing that I can't
So I've come forward with this to show you where I stand
Have you ever felt hated? Have you ever felt jaded?
I can't walk with all this weighing down on me
Have you been getting high? Have you been getting wasted?
Checking out from reality, just try to breathe

I don't see an end to my pain when I still have angst in my veins
And everything comes crashing down on me, when everyone is looking down on me

I only ask a single thing, just a moment of your time
I've let you show me all that is yours, now let me show you mine
And I just wanted to hear ""I miss you"" or ""I'm happy you made it out""
And I just needed to hear ""I love you"", ""I'm proud of what you're doing now""
I've seen the cuts on your arms, I've seen the scars on your wrists
And I just want you to know, you are better than this

I've seen the cuts on your arms, I've seen the scars on your wrists

Could be Warsaw, and it could be Moose Jaw
Could be Rome

Will you accept your second class status
A nation of waitresses and waiters?
Will you mix their martinis?
Will you stand still for it?
Or will you take to the hills?

It could be clay and it could be sand
Could be desert

Could be something you built on your own
Everybody got something he calls home

On each other at noon
In the cool dusty air of the city boardroom
Will you stand by a passive spectator
Of the market dictators?
Will you discreetly withdraw
With your ear pressed to the boardroom door?
Will you hear when the lion within you roars?
Will you take to the hills?

Could be the kid in the middle of the bomb sight
Could be a fanatic, could be a terrorist
Could be a dentist, could be a psychiatrist
Could be humble, could be proud
Could be a face in the crowd

That this is the end of the cat and mouse

The house that Jack built

Jah Will Never Leave I Alone,rock,Mike Love (Reggae),2014,"[Chorus]
In these troubling times
Money comes and goes
But one thing I know
Jah will never leave I alone

And the sun will shine
And the rain will fall
But I n I know
Jah will never leave I alone

[Verse 1]
I woke up early this morning
And Jah sun was not yet dawning
But I know in my heart it's gonna rise
Cause just before dawn the night is at its darkest
And just when you think what you seek is at its farthest
That's when Jah will show you you're standing at the finish line

Cause when you're running around you can't find the time to clear up your mind
And if you never Iditate you won't contemplate the mysteries of time
See you're a prisoner of a system of an ancient design
Watching your future become past is your favorite pastime
To break the bonds of this system of slavery is up to you
And your redemption will come if your words and actions are true
Because no matter what no one can make your choices for you
[Chorus]
In these troubling times
Money comes and goes
But one thing I know
Jah will never leave I alone

And the sun will shine
And the rain will fall
But I n I know

Believe me I know that its hard to be strong now
And believe me I know its hard to find where to belong now
But believe me when I tell you that things will be better soon

And believe me they could never harm us my bredren
Deceive we as we strive to rebuild our Zion
And believe me when I tell you that your future is up to you

So don't you let them make you there fool
Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, Jahman and start anew
Cause all this glamour is meant to do
Is to distract you and attack all of your weaknesses and who
Who will be your shepherd when you go astray and
Who will be your courage when you are afraid and
Who will be your guidance when you lose your way
Only Jah

I woke up early this morning
And Jah sun was not yet dawning

Thats when Jah will show you Jah will reach you Jah will teach you

Money comes and goes

Clandestine Ways Krokodil Rot,rock,Cattle Decapitation,2015,"The human animal
So similar in so many ways
To our mammalian counterparts
Experimented on in torturous ways
We've freed the ""specimens""
We've taken over the facility
We've captured these torturers
Time to teach them some humility

AH... syringes filled with dihydrodesoxymorphine
I've combed the streets in search of hypodermic
Needles and dirty sharps hoarding
All aboard this ship of fools, this train of pain is finally boarding
Tendinous disintegration, irreparable musculature goring

These shameless ways we get our fix
We get our kicks off human suffering
Through puncturing the skin accidentally restructuring
Epimysium covering

No need for anesthetics, your research for cosmetics landed
You here on my gurney, hurting, gurgling diuretics
Tube in your anus leads to open sores creating sepsis
Septic shock sets in - No asepsis in my cold aesthetics
Apathetic, yet frenetic, simply unsympathetic
Shredded limbs needing prosthetics, best to just call off the medics
How does it feel?
Multi-Dermal peel - that shall never heal
These clandestine ways - of distributing pain
Diseased train of thought - krokodil rot

Oh this desire... to see your limbs on fire...
This sick exhilaration... of total excruciation...

Ah these shameless ways we get our fix...
We get our kicks off human suffering
Through puncturing the skin accidentally restructuring

Of what this subspecies is capable of producing

A Wild Shameless Plain,rock,Every Time I Die,2012,"Old black tusks ripped off of the beast at the bank of the swamp
And carved into statues of arthritic gods
Or the handles of blunt swords that you'll one day run upon
With your eyes covered in moss

Shot down in its sleep
The big game of the world wide garbage heap
You mounted its head on your wall
The prize? Hollowed out eyes
Mold in the crack of its skull
The fur is matted with blood and its tongue wet with mother's milk

Gates opened wide and bedlam came
Wise men were forced into a layman's trade
With nothing but time, chaos reigns

A great quiet has followed you to here
A blustering wind with nothing of worth in its heart or hands

Your legacy is ""a dull catalogue of common things""
You've never even seen the blood you've drawn
Or looked in the eyes of the kill you claim was yours
Before taking your picture with it",2607,73039

Coasting and losing a half year

Knuckle to your teeth to kill the feeling
Sweating in your sleep

Hoping the world ends and breaks apart
Time stops
We die then we're better for it

Crooked arms
The schedule's always empty

So break down

You wanted more but all that's lеft is less
So call it quits
Stay awake at night
The light can only hurt your tirеd eyes
You're putting off the
Work that you can't leave or all is lost
Deep breaths and sleep turn to wasted time

Burning in your head
You're only here to feed and walk your pet
Your stomach's empty
Faking your smile on a phone call
Practice so nothing can look wrong

Pointed questions
Same form
No I've not been eating

So break down
Cuz there's nothing underneath
There's no one trying to compete for free

The lies, do you hear me?

And life is unfolding
Reckless and weary

[Verse 2]
Asleep is the safest place you can be
You can try hard to catch it, it just catches you
Imagine a camera coming up from your feet
Relax all your muscles, son, just hope your heart's in one piece

[Chorus]
Now, it's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything it decides to touch
It's bigger than a halo, a devil, an angel, and a crow
The bone's got the wrong detail, I hoped it would have
Save for a shinbone or even a hand
[Bridge]
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride

[Chorus]
Now, it's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything it decides to touch
The bone's got the wrong detail, I hoped it would have for you
Save for a shinbone or even a hand

There's a man on the corner selling dozens of bones
Every type of bone except the one that I want",2723,70899
Lost Highway,rock,Bon Jovi,2007,"[Verse 1]
In my rear view mirror
My life is getting clearer
The sunset sighs and slowly disappears
These trinkets once were treasure
Life changes like the weather
You grow up, grow old or hit the road 'round here
So I drive, watching white lines passing by
With my plastic dashboard Jesus, waiting there to greet us

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, I finally found my way
Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas there ain't no brakes on the lost highway
Yeah I'm busting loose, I'm letting go
Out on this open road
It's independence day on this lost highway

[Verse 2]
I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
Now I'm afraid of going back again
So I drive, years and miles are flying by
And waiting there to great us
Is my plastic dashboard Jesus

Hey, hey, I finally found my way
Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas there ain't no brakes on the lost highway
Yeah I'm busting loose, I'm letting go
Out on this open road
It's independence day on this lost highway

[Bridge]
Oh patron saint of lonely souls
To tell this boy which way to go
Guide the car, you got the keys
Farewell to mediocrity
Kicking off the cruise-control
And turning up the radio
Got just enough religion
And a half tank of gas come on
Let's go

[Chorus]
I finally found my way
Say goodbye to yesterday
Hit the gas there ain't no brakes on the lost highway
Yeah I'm busting loose, I'm letting go
Out on this open road
It's independence day on this lost highway",2969,66740

Give My Heart Away,rock,Motherfolk,2017,"Home
A place I never dared to call my own
When it was opened up to me I just left all alone
Because I was afraid
Not enough to admit I was every single day
When someone moves closer, I just move further away

I almost fell though
With a hundred thousand reasons not to let go
And I just sat there screaming, singing
""Hell no, I'm never going to give my heart away""

Well I know it's her
The one who makes it hard to find another
The one who wakes me up to remind me I'm still hurt
So I'll drink, yeah I'll drink it all away
And if that don't work, I'll drink more all the same
'Cause what I have is what I have, no poison could ever change
A little part of me that no one can ever save

I almost fell, though
With a hundred thousand reasons not to let go
And I just sat there screaming, singing
""Hell no, I'm never going to give my heart away""
She put up a fight, though
And I'd give up all my rights to see those eyes glow
And after all my pain, I might say
""Hell, though, I just might try to give my heart away""
And the edge of my seat is on the edge of my mind
(Won't be surprised this time, won't be left hanging on a line)
And the furthest from you is the closest I'll be
(My restless heart will set me free, never mind what I'm leaving)

A Corpse in My Bed,rock,Creature Feature,2007,"[Intro]
Ladies and gents, this next band hails from Los Angeles, California. And they're here to answer the question we are all thinking: does love ever truly die? Without further ado, Creature Feature!

[Verse 1]
Is it wrong to have a corpse in my bed?
I don't think so even if she is dead
Is it disturbing, is it a crime?
She's been expired for quite some time
I couldn't let her repose underground
A feast for worms inside her burial mound
Consecrated by the powers above
We fit like a severed hand in glove

[Chorus]
My only complaint's the perfume she wears
A mix of rancid milk and moldy pears
I'm just scared, don't want to be alone
Even if she's just skin and bones

[Verse 2]
Her skin is dry and body full of dust
One day I'm afraid she just might combust
I could never think of leaving her side
Even though it's been years since she died
[Chorus]
My only complaint's the perfume she wears
A mix of rancid milk and moldy pears
I'm just scared, don't want to be alone
Even if she's just skin and bones
Let me reiterate what has been said
Is it really that wrong to have a corpse in my bed?
I'm just scared, don't want to be alone
Even if she's just skin and bone

And of the sunny days, no traces remain

Casting a light which brings me peace
Where the caverns of death will freeze

Even though like a bird you flew
I will love you just the same

I am the blood, a fire in your soul
And I will grow in landscapes so cold

Oh, how I feel you in every single detail
As you lurk inside my troubled dreams
There is no hope as long we walk this Earth

Tonight we're racin' out of touch
Are we gettin' wise

Head high into the wild

But for now we’re speaking code

I know you’re gonna be the last one out of drought
When the late night knocks on us
I hope you’re gonna be the last one
I hope

Shot heard deadly in the night
We were being civilized
I’m losing my touch
And being rectified
So we’re wasting our love
While we’re getting wise

But tonight we’re speaking code
Head high into the wild
Contemplate loss and the consequence of getting old
But for now we’re speaking code

I know we’re gonna be alright
When the late night dons on us
I hope we’re gonna be alright

At the everlasting fire
Borne on waves of insanity
From mans primeval past
The mantra of the tumult
Has awakened him at last

The ravens of night have flown away
To set Valhalla aflame

Have fought between themselves
With paths that lead to paradise

Cows,rock,Sun Kil Moon,2019,"I drive the winter roads to Navarre after they've been plowed. I look off in the snow and saw the frost-bitten cows. I stare into the big, dumb, brown eyes and in those moments, I felt tranquilized

In those moments, I felt half anesthisized. In those moments in the back seat of my Mom's car, I felt hypnotized. In those moments, the AM radio played Riders on the Storm and I fall into the state of euphoria

Zarathustra was walking and felt something warm and living. Something warm and living nearby that refreshed, and stumbled upon the hill like full of cows. And in Nirvana, there was order and warmness that touched his heart. And there among them was the mountain sermonizer
""What do you see, kid?"", I asked Zarathustra
""Same things as you see"", the mountain man said. ""Happiness on Earth, you peace-breaker.""
""Why have you come here? Why have you disturbed them? Do you not know that if we not become as cows, we shall not enter into the gates of Heaven? For there is one thing we should learn from them. And that is rumination.""

In the end, Zarathustra talked him back to his cave of haunting. Zarathustra gave the mountain man shit for loving cows more than money. The mountain sermonizer said ""Well, guess what? I have news for you, Zarathustra, I have decided that, more than cows, I love you""
Zarathustra said ""Enough of your flattery"" and poked the [?] with a stick and he ran off nimbly

See, I grew up in Ohio in a rust belt town. And growing up, I gazed off at thousands of cows in my prepubescent years, throughout my teens. I saw lots of dairy cows, Guernseys, and Holsteens. From my perspective, the space between their ears was hollow. They did not know yesterday from two seconds ago from tomorrow. From my perspective, they did not feel happiness, they did not feel sorrow

Cows are harmless creatures, they are innocent. Every small thing they do is tender and sweet and benevolent. I looked back at those drives past with sweet sentiment. It was good to get away from the downtown mass in Ohio cement. Though those drives are sometimes boring and seem very far, I have fond memories of my mom dropping us off at a relative's in Navarre

Cow, Cow, Cow, Cow, Cow, Cow, Cow, Cow

Nietzsche's passage got me thinking about cows and this kick drum going ""Pow. Pow. Pow. Pow. Pow. Pow.""
Trigger the word ""cow"" and everything is unraveled from the word ""cow""
And this kick drum sound ""Pow. Pow. Pow. Pow. Pow.""
From this day forward, I solemnly vow to only once a month sink my teeth into the flesh of a cow
From this day forward, I solemnly vow to only once a month sink my teeth into the flesh of a cow
From this day forward, I solemnly vow to only once a month sink my teeth into the flesh of a cow
From this day forward, I solemnly vow to only once a month sink my teeth into the flesh of a cow
For I love steaks at Harris' restaurant on Havana Street, and bulgogi in Seoul, Korea or in New York on 32nd Street, and brisket at Jack's barbeque on Broadway in Nashville, Tennessee, and beef jerky at 7/11 when I'm on the road and I'm low on protein. To give up cow flesh entirely and completely at this stage of my life I'm afraid would be very hard for me. For half a century, I have enjoyed the tasty flavor of cow meat. Aw, it tastes so good, my mind's Chop Suey

See, as a kid in Ohio, driving out of town, they'd comfort me, gazing off at the cows. Then later I moved out to California and the most beautiful animals I still see are cows. Driving through Petaluma over to Bolinas Point, there are many cows grazing. On the way to the beach, when I see them, my body gets lazy, my mind gets all buzzy and hazy

Not far from my home is, in New Orleans now, is a closed down dirty plant where they used to be a statue of a cow. Why did I pick a home to a place so close to where they process the milk of cows? Every night I went to sleep and woke up to the milk truck sounds

And when I could barely walk, my dad worked at Overland Dairy, seven days a week, I asked him just today how much they paid him weekly. He said ""I don't remember, Mark, that was so long ago. But they gave me two free gallons of milk daily.""
I said, ""But I remember mom pulling milk bottles out of a silver box a couple times a week.""
He said, ""Well, Mark, that's after I quit my job as a milkman.""
I said ""Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense why it was mom who picked those heavy milk bottles up from the doorstep. Cause you had a new job and you were traveling around.""
He said ""Yeah, I was traveling regionally and was selling cold medicine from town to town.""

I don't eat much chicken. Better find a better finger licking, but I do love fish and I love Creole dishes. Gulf coast stores, just-fried gator and crawfish. I wouldn't be surprised if I died of a heart attack in Felix's in New Orleans. In fact if I fall over there and died, do not get all sappy. If I died in Felix's eating oysters and crawfish, know that I died happy

""God is dead"". With Nietzsche, on that, I agree. But where he stands on cows, I can not totally proceed. When I look out at the animals, they radiate serenity. Cows are as close to perfect beings as it gets to me

I look out into the bay and see the prow of an incoming scow. The picture calms my nerves when I stare out the window. Like a cow, my brain goes blank and I find peace in the here and now. I'm as calm as a pasture-grazing cow. Their moos, to my ears, are sweeter than a cat's meow. Flash Elorde fought many times at San Francisco's Cow Palace. And in the Garden, he fought Frankie Narvaez. My favorite part of the movie *Borat* is the part where he tries to kidnap Pamela Anderson, she runs away from the crowd and she's running through the parking lot screaming, he yells ""I will give you your own plow."" OK, that's all I've got, I've run out of thoughts about cows, at least for now",1876,90260

Thorn Tree in the Garden,rock,Derek and the Dominos,1970,"There's a thorn tree in the garden
If you know just what I mean
And I hate to hurt your feelings
But it's not the way it seems, 'cause I miss her

She's the only girl I've cared for
The only one I've known
And no one ever shared more love
Than we've known and I miss her

But it all seems so strange you see
'Cause she'd never turn her back on me
And leave without a last goodbye
And if she winds up walking the streets
Loving every other man she meets
Who'll be the one to answer why?
Lord, I hope it's not me, oh it's not me

And if I never see her face again
I never hold her hand
And if she's in somebody's arms
I know I'll understand but I'll miss that girl
Lord I still miss that girl
Maybe someday soon, some way",6940,35589

Hey, I can smell the cut grass

And it brought me back to life again

You've got a certain something about you
And I've got a past I want to leave behind
It's been a long, long time since I met someone
Who made me happy to be alive

Now the bell's of St. Paul's ring out in my head
Like the last few words she said

I can't go back to living in silence
No, I can't go back to sleeping alone
All the years she made me live as a liar
Ended up becoming all that I know

And I know you can't stand winters here
You said you never felt that kind of cold
I guess when you're from another hemisphere
It can sometimes feel like another world
You've got a way of making me hang on
To every single word you say
We stay up all night talking shit about
How I needed to get away

And opened a way to the nether
Riven world was plain to see
Eons hid her in plain sight
The storm she gave eyes to you and me

To love the light, the fire's spark
You must first have been buried in the deep down dark
Deep down dark

So we followed the line of a barn owl's flight
In those days, in those distant days
And set sail for the nether on the river of night
Wavеs like wolves in the shadows of blazе
Black hails struck like hammer blows
When again will the dead see the bright sun's rays

To love the light, the fire's spark
You must first have been buried in the deep down dark

Deep In the nether where the river slows
Reading a map with too many folds
Pulled down forever by the undertows
Till you lift me out of the water's jaws
Up through the gap in the roof of the night
And my bones grow again in the upper light
Pus flies on my skin roots pull me apart
I am green to my eyes and green to my heart

Well, a person can work up a mean, mean thirst
After a hard day of nothin' much at all

Smell the bodies of our elders
And wake up to the milky way at breakfast

So slow it down

I'll make it fit together real nice

Two days ago it was really bad
I couldn't get my head straight all day
And everything you said seemed to have an edge
You were disappointed and I didn't know why

Eventually it came to a head
Over something as stupid as making coffee
You said it was a mistake to ever try and help me
Then you went in the kitchen

I drove off to go buy some stuff
Which was a mistake because
I didn't want to come back
I just sat in the parking lot
And dabbed at my thumb, which was bleeding for some reason
Leaving a trail of red blossoms on the napkin
I felt sick and I didn't know what to do

My own style too

There are birds in the front yard
I feed them breadcrumbs from my bathrobe
In the morning
I stand admiring the colors

What you are born in?
But of course that's just your nature
As is mine to cover up my points of origin
Oh, but there are no hard feelings
Fly away

The only thing concealed
Is that there's nothing to conceal
It's the bluff that structures everything

Want to pare that apple peel
You'll see you wanted some love

Works my mind just like a maze
When I see you around

No honey you are not a kid
You know how to keep it hid
And I know just what you did
In those buildings downtown

In the party's balcony
Where you caught up with me
Said you were not through with me
Well I could have guessed

Afternoons were losing light
December's moon was shining bright
That's when that you thought you just might
Settle for the best

When we was in Vancouver town
The time that I finally let you down
You was in some evening gown
I was wearing jeans
Sometimes we run alongside each other
Sometimes it's like there's no other
Sometimes we make horrible lovers
Sometimes we're just mean

The way you kissed my unshaven face
And disappeared without a trace
Maybe I'll get my own little place
Overlooking the ocean

Pacific Northwest on a southbound train
Buffalo clouds hanging above the plain
Some say I'm different, some say I'm the same
Some say I go through the motions

Well something did change inside of me
Changed something in the way I see
I see those shadows hanging on the streets
You can't outmanoeuvre time

I'm only leaving 'cause I can't stay

I know that you know me
Though you try to hide my name
But I feel you at peace when you feel like a beast
I am there to hold your hand
You tried to hide me
Said I brought nothing but shame
But we're all born a fucking sinner
Hear me now? Scream my name

They call you king 'cause they only know all the pain I bring
Thrown to the wolves and made to believe

And I will build my castle with the ashes of your throne

You put me here, but I run this place
This is my home, it was once my cage
I'm okay, I'm doing fine

And life moving on, setting my heart
The sun's steady pressure saw the ticking stop
But I was all smiles

And I'm still always slowly waiting for what follows
For what I've learned about being so defined by someone dying
And for thinking before I speak
And hoping for something bigger, but it's a size I can't teach
For how things were or how they should be

So kill it before it determines who you’re gonna be today

King Procrastination waits his life away
In hopes someone will show him the path that he should take
Stay weary of the hopeless in hopes that you may find a better way to fly
Ooh yeah, life is a game until it hits you in the face
Such a shame, it's wasted on the...

You know I would hate to say “told you so.”
Forget your inhibitions, ready for the fall
The word on the wire, you’re living in denial
And you’re putting out the fire, and you’re letting go of your desires

So kill it before it determines who you’re gonna be today

Step at a time, know that you’re mine, not to borrow
So tell me why you’re running away, don’t you worry
Step at a time, know that you’ll find, there’s no sorrow
In places where your heart has a say
Do what you want and don’t let them see you run
Blood on the radio, there’s blood on the radio
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
So kill it before it determines who you’re gonna be today
Let all you think can’t be give way to possibility, you’ll see
You’re staring down the barrel of the permanence of truth
You’re giving in to every fear and I know what it’s doing

Ghosts,rock,August Burns Red,2015,"[Verse 1: Jake Luhrs]
We are the ghosts of the midway
The beasts of the alley
We are the living dead
Living in your nightmares
Scraping ourselves from the earth
Living as though we are dirt
Staring like you've seen a ghost
The lowest of the low with nowhere to go
Back from the dead, now we're grovelling at your feet
Handcuffed for lying our heads as we're withering in the streets
Back from the dead, now we're grovelling at your feet
Handcuffed for lying our heads as we're withering in the streets

[Verse 2: Jake Luhrs]
Fighting for your attention, begging for your generosity
Looking up just to see you turn your cheek on me
You walk on by like I'm invisible (Invisible)
All I want is to be seen as an equal
We fought your battles, and we built your homes
Sorry if I disturbed you
I just wish we could live like you do
[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Even in our most beautiful days it's dark
Just look at the world around you
There's a consequence for what we do
Pass judgment on me as you walk
Picture perfect ain't my obsession
You can't sum up my life from a first impression
Learn your lesson

[Bridge: Jake Luhrs & Jeremy McKinnon]
Act like you know me, but do you even know yourself?
When you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
Act like you know me, but do you even know yourself?
When you got nothin', you got nothin' to lose

I may have no one else to blame, but listen to me
You and I, we were once the same, the same
I may have no one else to blame, but listen to me
You and I, we were once the same
I may have no one else to blame, but listen to me
You and I, we were once the same, the same
I may have no one else to blame, but listen to me

Lump Street,rock,Frightened Rabbit,2016,"[Verse 1]
In a commissioned town, on Lump Street
The brick-hard boy repeats a scripted lie
Eyes to the ground on Lump Street
There's a broken jaw behind the dog-tooth smile

[Verse 2]
The grunt and moan behind the night here
And though breath is warm, sex is cold
Nothing is grown on Lump Street
Each piece is fired inside a broken mould

[Chorus]
Do you want more unshapely love?
What you waiting for? Cut out that lump

[Verse 3]
She tore his tongue out at the end of Lump Street
She liked to see the blood beneath his skin
He wore her muscles, kissed all of the bruising
Away, away
[Chrous]
Do you want more unshapely love?
What you waiting for? Cut out that lump

[Bridge]
He's a full-grown man, no shoulder to cry on
Raised by wolves and they taught him to bite down hard, ah ah ah
No locks on the doors, no corner to hide in
Scars like armour, dead boy's eyes, ah ah ah

She's a Lump Street girl, with a blade in her brow
Raised by the state but they tore it all down, ah ah ah
They fucked and they fought but it still felt right
Run away from these orange Lump Street lights, ah ah ah

No Place Here,rock,UADA,2020,"Among the liars
Flag fliers
Factual deniers
The war on instinct has begun
Scientific distortion
Philosophical contortion
Let it be abortion
That now grants us none
Mental regression
Self image obsession
Under the guise of oppression
They sanctimoniously leech
The revolutionaries
And over-reactionaries
Are the contemporaries
Who cannot practice what they preach

The false acusers
Privileged abusers
Bias users bathing in the bile they birth
The distribution
Of ones own confusion
Casts false illusions of what they deem of worth
Self reflective denial
Projecting outward trial
A plague so bile it shields the mortal mind
Hypnotizing the spineless
Capitalizing on blindness
Guided sightless is the humankind
Individualism versus collectivism
What is free will if the will cannot be free
With persuasion of denomination
Does what you believe bestow the right to deceive

Take what you've been handed
Endowed, inherited and granted
And through your fingers let it fall
With the alleviation of appreciation
Without double standards would there be any at all

I cannot see myself in this world being found, among those who claim down is up while others swear that up is down
There is no knowledge of the inhumanity once withstood, that could cease those from weaponizing their own victimhood
Where logic holds no validity over emotion, it is the taste of entitlement that detracts the relevance of their devotion
And it darkens the sense of a greater understanding, when they've fallen deaf to all dialogue other than their own demandings
And they focus their faith into a chosen form of extremism, like a swinging pendulum, the behest of a subconscious hypnotism
To insist immunity in the light of a false alliance, squealing foolishness to accompany the continued acts of their defiance
In the end they'll hear only what it is they want to hear, the weakening words of a failing campaign in which they choose to smear
The only consistency found can be within their own doubt, as they descend with communal ad hominem channeling casuistic clout
The most privileged protect their political pose, polarizing personal principle and propagating a platform for their phony prose
A fictitious brotherhood, a fraudulent kin, only projecting outward what it is that they so feel within
There is no reflection, restraint or redaction, to those who cannot take responsibility for the contamination of their own action
And they push their concepts of identity upon us all, out-thrusting nonsense so that they may have a sword on to fall
And we wait for the cowards to take their leave, for there is no trust, no virtue and definitely no honor among these thieves
Where every step is a contradiction to their last, a promenade on display, a forward march into their past
Through the intolerance of their desperate disposition shown, becoming disenfranchised by the infantile climates in which they've thrown
I cannot see myself among a flock controlled by fear, for I have no place there and they have no place here",1301,111993
To Crawl Under Ones Skin,rock,Neurosis,1992,"Isolated so long, blighted by the first frost
Longing for the warmth of human touch
Through this wall of ice I can see you

Callous only outside, from the kicking
And the beating down
Please rip them from my body, please!

Glacier growing larger
Mirror growing darker
Do you see the blue?

My forefront of consciousness
Has been ignored
The healing touch of time has abandoned me
Abandoned me!

The longing brings me near, but the fear
Keeps me inches, worlds away

Reaching through the ice at last
But you feel the frost and run
Run from me back to the secure
(You didn't belong here anyway)
And I'm left still
Still longing
Still cold
So cold",2237,80671

Happy Days,rock,Closure in Moscow,2014,"(Check it out!)
I won’t let anyone have mercy until you bring me down
Pretty little thing came up behind me
Twist and twirl, she damn near blind me
Then she smiled as she took my crown
I chased that pretty little thing all the way up the mountain
Just to see what I could see, what I could see
I saw her standing by a flagpole, guess what she said to me

""You're chasing happy days, tell me are you closer now?
(Look down, heaven's below)
Praising yesterday, dreaming of them better times
(You put ‘em up on a throne, and I won't let anyone have mercy until you bring ‘em down"")
Until you bring ‘em down

When I'd all but given up, my joy became a song
Felt it in the desert air, I had it all along

See the fool's thirst, it led me up, and now I lead the devil down
My silver-lining scepter called the wind to arms, my feet don't touch the ground
Blazing through the atmosphere on my brand new tiger-robot-wizard-shark
Truth be told I love the view up here, should have seen it from the start
You're chasing happy days, tell me are you closer now?
(Look down, heaven's below)
Praising yesterday, dreaming of them better times
(You put ‘em up on a throne and I won't let anyone have mercy until you bring ‘em down)
No, no, no!
(I won't let anyone have mercy until you bring ‘em down)

Chasing happy days, tell me are you closer now?
(Look down, heaven's below)
Praising yesterday, dreaming of them better times
(You put ‘em up on a throne and I won't let anyone have mercy until you bring ‘em down)
No, no, no!
(I won't let anyone have mercy until you bring ‘em down)

Pretty little thing, platinum sheen
I'm coming up strong, ain't fazed by the gleam
Dancing around the sun
Hard to believe I was, swimming in my mind, lost in the sea
Quick fix schemes had a hold on me
Now I just smile because, everything always was, just the way that it should have been
Oh them happy days are here
Feeling good, feeling fine, 'scuse me while it blows my mind

The future is fine (Future is fine)
My soul is elated (My soul is...)
She's coming on home and I'm kissing the face of infinity
She's sweet and she's sour (Sweet and sour)
She said to me baby she said don't let happy days just pass you by
The future is fine (Future is fine)
My soul is elated (My soul is...)
She's coming on home and I'm kissing the face of infinity
She's here to stay
Whispering softly
Don't let happy days just pass you by",7320,34081
Northwest Passage,rock,The Dreadnoughts,2019,"[Verse 1]
Westward from the Davis Strait
'Tis there 'twas said to lie
The sea route to the Orient
For which so many died
Seeking gold and glory
Leaving weathered, broken bones
And a long-forgotten lonely cairn of stones

[Chorus]
Ah, for just one time
I would take the Northwest Passage
To find the hand of Franklin
Reaching for the Beaufort Sea
Tracing one warm line
Through a land so wild and savage
And make a Northwest Passage to the sea

[Verse 2]
Three centuries thereafter
I take passage overland
In the footsteps of brave Kelso
Where his ""sea of flowers"" began
Watching cities rise before me
Then behind me sink again
This tardiest explorer
Driving hard across the plain
[Chorus]
Ah, for just one time
I would take the Northwest Passage
To find the hand of Franklin
Reaching for the Beaufort Sea
Tracing one warm line
Through a land so wild and savage
And make a Northwest Passage to the sea

[Verse 3]
And through the night, behind the wheel
The mileage clicking west
I think upon Mackenzie
David Thompson and the rest
Who cracked the mountain ramparts
And did show a path for me
To race the roaring Fraser to the sea

[Chorus]
Ah, for just one time
I would take the Northwest Passage
To find the hand of Franklin
Reaching for the Beaufort Sea
Tracing one warm line
Through a land so wild and savage
And make a Northwest Passage to the sea
[Verse 4]
How then am I so different
From the first men through this way?
Like them, I left a settled life
I threw it all away
To seek a Northwest Passage
At the call of many men
To find there but the road back home again

[Chorus]
Ah, for just one time
I would take the Northwest Passage
To find the hand of Franklin
Reaching for the Beaufort Sea
Tracing one warm line
Through a land so wild and savage
And make a Northwest Passage to the sea",2618,72835
Accept Yourself,rock,The Smiths,1984,"[Verse 1]

When will you accept yourself?

How dearly I'd love to get carried away
Oh, but dreams have a knack of just not coming true
And time is against me now

Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
When will you accept yourself?
For heaven's sake
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
Every day you must say
How do I feel about the past

Others conquered love, but I ran
I sat in my room and I drew up a plan
Oh, but plans can fall through, as so often they do
And time is against me now

[Chorus 2]
And there's no one left to blame
Tell me when will you
When will you accept your life
The one that you hate
For anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
Every day you must say
How do I feel about my shoes

[Verse 4]
They make me awkward and plain
How dearly I would love to kick with the fray
But I once had a dream and it never came true
And time is against me now
Time is against me now

And there's no one but yourself to blame

When will you accept yourself?

I break guitars; I Waits my voice
To feel again by damaging perfect sound

If rock and roll is dangerous

I have learned how to destroy
To irritate and to annoy
With clumsy hearts and honest frets
And ugly sound

If rock and roll is dead again
How come I can't stop listening?

The wild hum of drugs and sound
The basement is alive and loud

Burst out of the sand
With a bunch of flowers

Apparition comes
With a long and winning

Off the diving board
Blend into the light
Down the cable lines
Roll under the earth
Reforming on the wind
Two places at once
Taste the air with you
Undo all the ties
Wish that I could flip
One of those lies
Lift this all away
See that stretchy smile go
Right across your face

Will keep us all apart

All that's left for me is just to let this go
Let this go

Don't you say
That I sound too jaded
Always overthinking
Long way to go from here
Don't you waste
Days that I feel unworthy
Numb to my worries
Long way to go from here

Hollow and alone
Not meant to be loved
Forever on my own
Hollow and alone
Forever on my own

Days that I feel unworthy
Numb to my worries

Black Is the Soul,rock,Korn,2016,"[Verse 1]
As it all falls down
Do I walk away?
Or do l stand my ground
And accept my fate?

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night
I hear the demon sing

[Chorus]
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow
[Verse 2]
Happiness is found
In darkest ways
And as I search around
I knew nothing but mistakes

And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night
I hear the demon sing

[Chorus]
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

[Bridge]
And when you scream
You push me so much further ahead
And when I leave
I always walk right back again
And when you cry
The tears are cleansing bitterness
I'm out of time
I'm slowly dying, give me back my life!
Just give me back my life!
Just give me back my life!
Just give me back my life!
[Chorus]
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?

You're leading me to places I can never follow

Hum Hallelujah,rock,Fall Out Boy,2007,"[Verse 1]
It's all a game of this or that, now versus then
Better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone who knows someone I once knew
And I just want to be a part of this
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it

[Chorus]
So hum ""Hallelujah"" just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

[Verse 2]
My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
A remix of your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it
[Chorus]
So hum ""Hallelujah"" just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part

One Great City,rock,The Weakerthans,2003,"Late afternoon, another day is nearly done
A darker grey is breaking through a lighter one
A thousand sharpened elbows in the underground
That hollow hurried sound, feet on polished floor
And in the dollar store, the clerk is closing up
And counting loonies trying not to say

I hate Winnipeg

The driver checks the mirror seven minutes late
The crowded riders' restlessness enunciates
The Guess Who sucked, the Jets were lousy anyway
The same route everyday
And in the turning lane
Someone's stalled again
He's talking to himself
And hears the price of gas repeat his phrase

I hate Winnipeg

And up above us all
Leaning into sky
Our golden business boy
Will watch the North End die
And sing, “I love this town”
Then let his arcing wrecking ball proclaim
I hate Winnipeg",18732,15150

When I was out of sorts
It really meant a lot to be
In someone else's thoughts
Someone else's mind
Someone else as kind as you

A difference in my life
I won't forget how unafraid
You were that long dark night
I thought that all was lost
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind as you
I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there for me

How kind of you to stick by me
During the final bout
And listen to the referee

Its Darker Than You Think,rock,Carpathian Forest,2003,"My cold goddess of the night
Squirming under my spiked fist
She's giving me all carnal delights
Submit yourself and drink my blood

I am the bringer of hate
Evil reigns supreme on earth
Defenders of the blackest faith
Which strengthen my inner glow
Mind expanding inner journey
From a grim and bitter soul
Misanthropic violent hellblast
It's darker than you think...

For seemingly endless time
There is still blood on the old oak
This is where you come to die
Over three hundred years old
And still stretching towards the sky
The hangman's oak...
Burning, bleeding, dying
From the inside
Hitting, whipping, kicking
Tthe corpse of christ!!!
Reading, learning, seeing
All knowledge of evil
Watching, waiting, observing
My fallen angel...

I am the mortal guide
With spiritual possessions
I have seen the other side
And I have sold my soul!!!

I have no earthly tombstone
And I have no christian grave
I am a misanthrope
I am not a fucking slave!!!

I wear a 36 long, white is my color
A little tight in the shoulder
But you know, it still fit me good

Anyone can see we're a perfect match
An innocent boy and a psychopath
A week's worth of dating and you talk about moving in
(I talk about moving too fast)
My mom disapproved and my friends would say
To break the girl's heart but I'm too afraid
Her clickbait body was a tractor beam
She was a Tesla Model S with the ludicrous speed
The sex was good but we always fight
I'd try to leave your sorry ass but end up spending the night
Your sweetness, my weakness, you're mean though ingenious
Nothing can go between us (Aye, have you seen us?)

But you had to go testing me, gave me suicide tendencies
Your little games, your little, little games
You tricked me into staying, your playing is getting lame
From touching your sweet things to tracking your calls
Go from smacking your ass to punching holes in the walls
Go from sending me fire news to eyeing up other dudes
From picking a favorite song to playlisting breaking tunes
Started so high, now I can hardly breathe
Go from weak in the knees to be too weak I can't leave
You called it, it's all my fault, this I know
Guess I'm better off dead inside than being alone

Turning man against his brother
Till man exists no more

Nazarene, what can you offer?
Since the hour you vomited forth
From the gaping womb of a woman
You have done nothing
But drown men's soaring desires
In a deluge of sanctimonious morality
I was conceived of a jackal
Your pain on the cross was but a splinter
Compared to the agony of my father
I will drive deeper the thorns
Into your rancid carcass
You profaner of Isis
Cursed Nazarene
I will avenge thy torment

Now, Disciples of the Watch
See your Prince of Darkness rise
Through famine and destruction
The Four Horsemen at my side
I demand a victory
I demand a sacrifice
Or spend all eternity
In the flaccid gut of Christ

Hello Darkness my old friend,rock,Nightmare6,2019,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",8159,31198

Was the price I paid not enough
To prove my devotion to You

From being a faithful servant

Same Situation,rock,Joni Mitchell,1974,"[Verse 1]
Again and again the same situation
For so many years
Tethered to a ringing telephone
In a room full of mirrors
A pretty girl in your bathroom
Checking out her sex appeal
I asked myself when you said you loved me
Do you think this can be real?

[Verse 2]
Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering where it had to go
With heaven full of astronauts
And the Lord on death row
While the millions of his lost and lonely ones
Call out and clamour to be found
Caught in their struggle for higher positions
And their search for love that sticks around

[Verse 3]
You've had lots of lovely women
Now you turn your gaze to me
Weighing the beauty and the imperfection
To see if I'm worthy
Like the church, like a cop, like a mother
You want me to be truthful
Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though
And I need your approval
[Verse 4]
Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering who was there to hear
I said, ""Send me somebody
Who's strong and somewhat sincere""
With the millions of the lost and lonely ones
I called out to be released
Caught in my struggle for higher achievements
And my search for love that don't seem to cease",4979,46140

What a Horrible Night to Have a Curse,rock,The Black Dahlia Murder,2007,"This twisted, wretched place shadowed by the utmost darks of hell
In dreams of black, beyond the bounds of a withered witch's spell
Where the doors surely are locked when the sun threatens to wane
Where shamblers dwell in dim moon light beyond the warmth of day

Liars line the roads at dawn
Watchful eyes are upon you held
Sacred weapons to the sacred revealed to be unleashed its the council of hell
Blood flows down the streets at night where wolves cry out for flesh
Where a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby with the forms of the walking dead

Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
They dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck
His spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land
Freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man

Into the tower, never go; the horrors multiply
The gears can mince the strongest ones, leaving heroes paralyzed
The rivers flow with poison
The sands swallow you whole
The ghouls that roam this darkened wood are thirsting for your throat
Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
They dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck
His spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land
Freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man",18940,14995

Eight ball of blow and a half pound of weed
Heading down the track to Mexico
Fucked on beer and staying gold

Sixty one more, but from a liquor store

Removal of the eyes gives my heart a sudden chill
I preserve them in formaldehyde to gaze upon at will
How their greenish flecks befell me that starlit winter's night
I lost all that I ever was while locked within their sight

Before you sits a broken man, your fragile pinkish heart in hand
Peculiar how it can hurt so bad while love is only in the mind
I sew the gaping chest work, each thread is made with love
The bosom where I would rest my face is covered in your blood

No, this is not the end
You'll live on eternally

My secret you'll forever be

The coil of entrails, how curious the smell
So pungent to my eager nostrils, hands further compelled
No. No, it's not the end
Forever you'll be in my arms

I could never let you go, my darling, cold and blue
I wonder, are you dreaming still, spread-eagled, blood removed
I weave the sucking trocar beneath your bruising skin
Tonight I'll lay beside you, darling, in necromantic sin

Pinned to the bed sheets like a prized butterfly (you're mine)
I hear your voice so precious, echoing deeply inside
I did my best to love you while you did live and breathe

Now all the white boys in their Sta-Prest slacks
At home for the Summer from college
Staying out late getting rowdy at the bar
And looking for trouble uptown

Smashing their bottles in the gutter
Yelling all kinds of obscenities
About women and God and law

That girl was my sister
Just got off the night shift at Pettington's Place
Just want to go home, get some sleep
Boys grab her by the waist with the caffeine eyes
Their hands all fidget electric
I picked up a brick from my Papa's front yard
And threw it at the tallest boy's face
Well, blood was streaming like a well that sprung
I couldn't believe what I had just done
Well, the other boy ran and this one stayed
On the ground and he would never move again

[Verse 1]
It's not like there's a book for this, or something you could read
Cause I’ve looked around
And I tried to fill these holes with other roles that I never learned to play
It seems like they always falter, but how the hell should I know?
Cause it always seems to disappear so quickly you can’t see
Could somebody tell me, where does the time go?
I’ve got a bigger pile of questions than really I could ever need
There’s no explaining these

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve never heard a word about the way we’re all received
At least that I believe in
And I know traditions tell it, it's different, they spell it all it out to be
There’s no need to confuse me

[Chorus]
Cause I know what I know
And if everyone’s all subscribed, to fictions that can’t be right
Then spinning, we all collide one big typo this puppet show

[Verse 2]
I’d usually begin this conversation differently
I know it's kinda one sided
It’s so obvious the answer is a question I believe
That nobody’s asking, but what the hell do I know?

If everyone’s so unsure of
What's really below or above us
Then maybe we all buy in
And make our own collective end

Filling me up from my feet to the grooves in my fingertips

'Cause I'm swallowed up by the touch of somebody new

I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you
I felt it for you

When I'm lying in my bed I see the outline of your head where you used to lie
In the corner by the door there's a t-shirt on the floor that you left behind, when you said goodbye
Time runs away with me and I'm losing track
Picturing you here and it's taking me back to a time before my heart was broken and blue

I felt it for you

I felt it for you
I felt it for you

Filling me up from my feet (I felt it for you, I felt it for you)

Years went by in a blink of an eye
Finally got you out of my life
Found a cool girl who loves me
Are you still thinking of me?
We were so young and different then
What would you do if you saw me again?
Would you still recognise me?
Would you just walk right by me?
Well I hope you found the love in the heart of someone new
I hope you found the love so true

Book of the Fallen,rock,Caladan Brood,2013,"Still we ride, fight, and die
Wayward path far beyond the pale
We are lost, marching on
Heavy hearts longing for those lands we once called home

Emerald hills, sparking seas
Fade to distant memory
Horizons blaze in foreign land
Ochre seas of scorching sand

The fires of Y’Ghatan burn in the night
The shadows of a fallen god
Chains against light

For weeks on end we journey on
Weary and worn, the glory is gone
All that’s left are tired souls
Aching limbs and dreams of home

The fires of Y’Ghatan burn in the night
The shadows of a fallen god
Chains against light
Marching on as one as the ghosts of brothers sing
Deep in the night where their faces haunt our dreams
Halfway through the veil we are summoned to Hood’s gate
Lands rimed in frost, they will damn us to our fate

Push on through the din of the slaughter
Flight through this perilous land
To where our blades spring forth
Soldiers of Empire Malazan
We fight for the seat of the highborn
Our fates were never our own
Weathered skin is battered and broken
Bloodstained dawn in a land unknown

Stars reign in the sky of the desert
Lost in the blistering sands
A host now long forgotten
Soldiers of Empire Malazan
Far away from the hearths of our fathers
We’re never returning home
Weathered swords are a warrior’s burden
Battles fought but our deeds will go untold

Still we ride, fight, and die
Wayward path far beyond the pale
We are lost, marching on
Heavy hearts longing for those lands we once called home
Dawn has brought its cleansing light
So we behold a mournful sight
The fading sounds of clashing steel
Bodies strewn across the field

The fires of Y’Ghatan burn in the night
The shadows of a fallen god
Chains against light

Buried seeds, scattered bones
Blazing hearts by steel sent home
Mortal screams, names unknown
Shattered dreams by steel sent home

Strap on your shields and raise your banners
Hear the call of raging battle
Beneath a hail of burning arrows
Push ever forward, never surrender
Siege weapons tolling out like thunder
Ripping the city walls asunder
Columns of flame reach ever skyward
Horizons filled with burning pyres",3158,63935

I prayed the day you passed, but the heavens didn't listen
So we held you 'til your dark skin dulled to fair
Went out to smoke a dart, finally get some time alone
But just broke down and held my wife beneath the stairs
'Cause I saw our little life ascending from the street
And flung from overpass to overpass, collapsing in a heap
But to cradle you the last days was an honour
And a miserable feat

[Chorus]
I still need you in everything
I will need you in everything

[Verse 2]
The places you have walked, I consider holy ground
And I will love the things you love
Despite my prior thoughts about
And I'll think of you each day as if to nourish me from inside out
Now I speak to you in tongues, and seek for you in pain
And long for echoes in the silence born of islands and of rain
Every hymn and all the sounds that bind the many of us
Fiercely to the sea
[Chorus]
I will hear you in everything
I will hear you in everything

[Verse 3]
I prayed for you in song and kneaded through your veins
And chased the morsels of your voice
And gave you shots to ease the pain
When you asked us for some wine, we bought the best stuff
And we laughed and watched you drink
Now I smell you in the air and I pause to breathe you in
And I have torn apart your closet and devoured the scent within
You ascend in every skyline
All the water and the streets of Grey Lynn

[Chorus]
I will feel you in everything
I will feel you in everything

[Verse 4]
How do I face the world? Or raise a fuckin' kid?
Or see beauty in the Earth and all its majesty replete
When I've spent the better part of my twenties
Doing self-indulgent bullshit on repeat?
So if there's something of you here in the ever-changing light
Holding close to my unsteady heart and bonding me to life
May your spirit never leave me in the boredom
And the utterly sublime
[Chorus]
'Cause I will look for you every time
I will look for you every time

[Verse 5]
It'll torture me at first, then it'll hurt a little less
And I will pour through every piece of you 'til nothing new is left
Just your eyes in my reflection
And the heavy thing now beating in my chest
We held you in your bed, we washed you in your sheets
And sang you hymnals from the islands 'til you drifted off to sleep
Then I kissed the hands that raised me for the last time
And stared out into the street

[Chorus]
I will see you in everything
I will see you in everything
I will see you in everything
I will see you in everything",3987,54160
Head in the Clouds,rock,Hot Flash Heat Wave,2018,"Girl, you’re bringing out the worst side of me
Tune in and out of your frequency
Fuck the weather the sun is never shining down on me

Fluttering in my chest

Rags or of scraps. Pristine…

Finished spitting on me
Concentrating instead on painting a
Faithful portrait splashed across
The canvas of the wine read heavens

His surfeit has become his demise?
How much is enough to kill yourself?

When I got back along my road
All the trees had come out the screen
Nobody called for many days
I was left in my little world
Lived through the smell of painted floors
Echoing the sound
Off running water through the pipes
And posters falling down

[Verse 2]
When I woke up the second day
All the noises have disappeared
Down the street I chose a path
And walked to the end of it
Of all the words you sent to me
There was one that I couldn't bear
One that for me meant everything

I could listen to you speak all day

In the silence dripping wet with
Kisses running down my lips
Could be just a good friend
Who knows at this point anyway

There's just something about the way you surrender your eyes
Without this barrier of bodies, we'd already be inside

Like two children at first glance
We're building castles in the sand
It is so delicately dreamt of
This immediate intimacy

On the way to California
And I don't mean California literally

I'm not dreaming
I'm not dreaming
I'm not dreaming

I've got a feeling buried deep down
And who knows what it means to have a feeling
Buried so deep down

I've never felt quite so open before
And maybe my imagination runs away with me

Miss Bottom of the Hill,rock,Iron & Wine,2017,"[Verse 1]
So Miss Bottom of the Hill what do you want?
The sun is shinin' and your lovers always lose you in the dark
And they were all chosen to remember how the sparrows hit the window
That you closed to keep the cat out in the yard

And like your body bein' dragged behind the moon
You bring a memory of your mother like the money in your shoe
And how her penetratin' wisdom, her bulletproof religion
Always rip you like a wool off of the loom

You floated farther than you ever meant to go
And only now see you are naked when the wind began to blow
There's no advice that you've been missin'
No trespass unforgiven
Just a river with no pity for your boat

[Chorus]
I've come to know that I was stealin' all your kisses on the evenin'
The dogs were loose and lyin' on the street
You've learned to blend into the choir
How to hold your hand in fire
And what to say instead of what you mean
But the trouble it saves for just how hard it can be
[Verse 2]
You met the women gluin' jewels onto a crown
You know men hidin' in the city and their way of bein' found
And you got nothin' on your shoulders
Still there's nothin' too much colder
Than a rubble of a house that's fallin' down

Like a baby cryin 'til it falls asleep
The autumn's over by the time you count the color of the leaves
You're paintin' buzzards on the ceilin'
Fallin' faithless at the healin'
With your friends around you wailin on their knees

[Chorus]
And I've come to know that I was stealin' all your kisses on the evenin'
The fog had swallowed everything but us
You've learned to balance on the cable
Drink us all under the table
And who to try instead of who you trust
With a hand on your heart that threw you under the bus

[Verse 3]
So Miss Bottom of the Hill, what do you want?
The sun is shinin' and you cleaned your pretty pistol of a heart
But when you talk about tomorrow
When to beg and when to borrow
Is how to hit the ground before you hear the shot
And like a fish too deep and driftin' in the sea
You've grown accustomed to the blindness lookin' up and anxiously
But there's a stone inside your pocket while you're plowin' through the market
But you know even the time it takes ain't free

[Chorus]
I've come to know that I was stealin' all your kisses on the evenin'
The stars were barely hangin' in the sky
You've learned to eat when you're not hungry
How to laugh when nothin's funny
And what to get instead of gettin' by
But oh, how it changes with the passin' of time

[Verse 4]
You heard so many voices hidden in the wind
See all the children of the world and how its fingers reach for them
Two branches tired of their bendin'
I don't see our story endin'
Quite as clean as it was easy to begin

Like a hole that let the fox under the fence
You've got no solace and no sanctuary you can recommend
Beggin' for mercy at the bedside
We got frozen in the headlights
But our kind of mercy never made much sense
[Chorus]
I've come to know that I was stealin' all your kisses on the evenin'
But both were disappearin' in the waves
You've learned to lead the one you follow
How to spit out what you swallow
And when to hand instead of give away
That secret of ours is one I'll take to the grave

[Verse 5]
So Miss Bottom of the Hill what do you want?
The sun is shinin' and I think you want me more often than not
But like your father in the garden
I won't finish what I started
'Til you bill me for the flowers I forgot

And like a curse too old for anyone to care
You said to meet you on the mountain cause you never make it there
And sucked your thumb along the highway
Proudly promisin' that one day
I'd miss the way we tumbled down the stairs

[Chorus]
And I've come to know that I was stealin' all your kisses on the evenin'
The car was gently glidin' off the road
You've learned to rise above your body
How to never say you're sorry
And where to go instead of going home
With the light by the bed and all the clothes you've outgrown",1951,88027

Virginia Tech kid showing off his AK to subs on the internet
Tomorrow we're gonna be at the Brussels train station
Terrorism doesn't end, does it
Bombs going off at train stations and office buildings and airports
Turn on the news for the latest death toll report
And as we're driving, I look out [?] from the bales of hay
I hate to say it but on that guy who ruined Bastille Day
I hoped the cops put ninety-four bullets in his fucking brains
It pours, it pours, it pours, it pours, it pours
And it pours when it rains
People in France are in debilitating pain today
So send some love and if you don't then hang your fucking head in shame
If you believe in God, say, ""My father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name but forgiving those who trespass against us is in-fucking-sane.""

Went for a walk around my hotel in Milan
Pink or white oleanders flourishing on the hotel lawn
I saw a lizard on the sidewalk and he scurried away
This tour has been a grind and it was nice to get out and breathe the air today
Now we're in the van and we're going to stop for Italian food
Someone said, ""Hey, on the other hand, did you hear the positive news?""
Mick Jagger announced his girlfriend's pregnancy
He's seventy-two, she's a ballerina in her 20s
Hey, I gotta admit I kinda envy that dude
When my grandpa was seventy-two he was being fed baby food with a plastic spoon
His eyes were like a fish that's faded gray and blue
And off his chin, the candy stripers were wiping off his drool

And we're in the van listening to Faith No More's ""King for a Day""
Our driver Francesco listens to this one to keep himself awake
And as we drive I think about the future of my nieces
I hope the world in her 20s hasn't been blown to fucking pieces
And as we drive and I'm looking at tall, skinny pines
[?] never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever had to actualize
It's my last summer being forty-nine
Considering everything, I gotta say I'm doing fine
Thought I'm gonna sing this song in Bologna tonight
I'm gonna sing it for France and burn a candle for them tonight
And if Rush is out there somewhere on tour today
I hope for France they're playing Caress of Steel's ""Bastille Day""
And when they're marching on Bastille Day
For Nice, France that day is never gonna be the same
And when they're marching on Bastille Day
For Nice, France that day is never gonna be the same
While they were marching on Bastille Day
A guillotine had claimed her bloody prayer
While they were marching on Bastille Day
A guillotine had claimed her bloody prayer
While they were marching on Bastille Day
A guillotine had claimed her bloody prayer
While they were marching on Bastille Day",2576,73619
Everything  More,rock,Gengahr,2019,"All time low
And I can’t seem to find my way out
Misplaced so soon
An evening in your past

For the chance to say what I’d do
All the waking hours
I regret the way I left things now
And that’s what really hurts

Burned right through
A pity that it’s taken so long
Each passing sun
Brighter now it’s gone
Oh I’ve held it too
Bleeding in my arms

For a chance to say what I’d do
All the waking hours
I regret the way I left things now
And that’s what really hurts
Hold me closer now
I’m feeling like you’ve got to know
Now it’s everything and more
Hold me closer now
I’m feeling like you’ve got to know
Now it’s everything and more

Fading night, keep aching back
Earth bound, a tear in the unknown
Forcing time
Broad daylight
Honey I wanna go to war with you
I’m sorry that I couldn’t let it go now too

For the chance to say what I’d do
All the waking hours
I regret the way I left things now
And now it’s everything and more

Honey I wanna go to war with you
I’m sorry that I couldn’t let it show now too
And now it’s everything and more

Hold me closer now
I’m feeling like you’ve got to know
Now it’s everything and more
Hold me closer now
I’m feeling like you’ve got to know
Now it’s everything and more",1477,104064
Heartbeat,rock,Mike Love (Reggae),2014,"How much do I owe you
You gave me my heartbeat
As I search for the words to say my tongue falls away
You are my heartbeat
As pure and as true as the ocean is blue
My heartbeat

You were by my side
When all I had was a dream
And a gleam in my eye
So I'll never forget you
I'll always love you
You
You had my back
When all I had was a five string guitar and a knapsack
So I'll never forget you
I'll always Love you

Cause when the rain came
You were my ark
You were my shelter
And when the sun shone
You were right there to fill me with laughter
Oh Mama
You gave me life
Gave me your breast when you were bleeding inside
And I'll never forget how you held me
The first time a girl that I loved ever left me
And oh Papa
You gave me my voice
And through it all
Always gave me a choice
And I finally overstand how you taught me
Your shining example of Love and positivity
Even through the worst
You always put me first
And suffered the cost
For every battle I lost
And now I
I can't imagine another
More perfect mother and father

All through my life
You always had my back
Gave me more
Than in a lifetime I could ever pay back
So I just needed to tell you
How much I love and respect  you
All the sacrifices you made
Are lessons growing in me now
All the Love you gave is living within me
Within my heartbeat

You were by my side
When all I had was a dream and a gleam in my eye
So I'll never forget you
I'll always love you
You
You had my back when all I had was a five string guitar and a knapsack
So I'll never forget you
I'll always Love you

Heartbeat
You are my heartbeat
My heart beats in you",1330,110566
Sad Supermarket Song,rock,Mozes and the Firstborn,2019,"[Verse 1]
And while we're striding down the aisle
Something's off in me again
Dramatically I greet a child
My daddy be a single man

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, no more
Oh no, no more
Chorus now

[Chorus]
I cannot help but feel a tremor
When I buy oatmeal at the store
Because the radio is jammin'
I feel the pain and buy some corn
Everything the singer's saying
It tears my heart apart for sure
Sad supermarket song is playing
And it can never be unheard
[Verse 2]
My fridge is filled with meat and dairy
Stocked up on chocolate galore
A bunch of fruit is necessary
I'll go out later, get some more

[PreChorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Yet again

[Chorus]
I cannot help but feel a tremor
When I buy oatmeal at the store
Because the radio is jammin'
I feel the pain and buy some corn
Everything the singer's saying
It tears my heart apart for sure
Sad supermarket song is playing
And it can never be unheard

[Bridge]
No more
No, no more
Sad supermarket song
[Chorus]
I cannot help but feel a tremor
When I buy oatmeal at the store
Because the radio is jammin'
I feel the pain and buy some corn
Everything the singer's sayin'
It tears my heart apart for sure
Sad supermarket song is playing
And it can never be unheard
No, it can never be unheared",3051,65505

Harbour,rock,Moby,2002,"[Verse 1: Sinéad O’Connor]
The street bears no relief
When everybody's fighting
The street bears no relief
With light so hot and binding
I run the stairs away
And walk into the nighttime
The sadness flows like water
And washes down the heartache
And washes down the heartache

[Chorus: Sinéad O’Connor]
My heart is full
My heart is wide
The saddest song to play
On the strings of my heart

[Verse 2: Sinéad O’Connor]
The heat is on its own
The roof seems so inviting
A vantage point is gained
To watch the children fighting
So lead me to the harbour
And float me on the waves
Sink me in the ocean
To sleep in a sailor's grave
To sleep in a sailor's grave
[Chorus: Sinéad O’Connor]
My heart is full
My heart is wide
The saddest song to play
On the strings of my heart
My heart is full
My heart is wide
The saddest song to play
On the strings of my heart",1378,108326
