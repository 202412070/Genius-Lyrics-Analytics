Ahh, mmm

[Verse 1]
No words
My tears won't make any room for 'em
And it don't hurt like anything I've ever felt before
This is no broken heart
No familiar scars
This territory goes uncharted
Just me, in a room sunk down in a house in a town, and I
Don't breathe, though I never meant to let it get away from me
Now I have too much to hold
Everybody has to get their hands on gold
And I want uncharted

[Pre-Chorus]
Stuck under the ceiling I made
I can't help the feeling

[Chorus]
I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started, it's all uncharted
La la la-a-a-a, oh
[Verse 2]
Each day
I'm counting up the minutes, 'til I get alone, 'cause I can't stay
In the middle of it all, it's nobody's fault, but I'm so low
Never knew how much I didn't know
Oh, everything is uncharted

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm getting nowhere, when I only sit and stare like

[Chorus]
I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started, it's all uncharted

[Bridge]
Jumpstart my kaleidoscope heart
I love to watch the colors fade
They may not make sense, but they sure as hell made me
I won't go as a passenger, no
Waiting for the road to be laid
Though I may be going down
I'll take in flame over burning out
Compare where you are to where you want to be
And you'll get nowhere
[Chorus]
I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started
Oh, I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started, it's all uncharted

Like a slowly smoked cigarette
Oh the nights I spent feeling lonely
Whilst my tear ducts started to sweat
I hope you're happy now that you left my sheets stained with memories
You left an illness here
Made me feel real weird
There's no remedy

[Chorus]
But will we always be enemies?
Can you depart from washing my heart?
I'm hitting restart

I'm shaking now
Coz I'm draining the cold from my head
Are you dreaming now
Of the things we could have unsaid?
I'm lying in the dirt thinking ""what is worse?""
I miss your smell and your smile
I miss the way you danced
As our love romanced on the cold dark tiles

""Goodbye, goodbye""
I said to my best-est buds
We said that we'd keep in touch
And we did our best

We smile at party time
But soon we forget to smile
At anything else

Won't you help me sober up?

Although many contend
You can find hope ascend
To mark just how everything changes
Be it the temperature highs
Or the sea level rising
It's all going up but the wages

And murdered reporters
And talk of hard borders
Sky-bound as a heavenly choir
Or the stock price in Boeing
The screams of the dying
Or the skies over Yemen last night

[Chorus]
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
[Verse 2]
Don't mention the rent
Or the money that's spent
Keeping the banks in good health
Or ridiculous claims
Or the level of blame
Pointed to anything else

And preachy musicians
And those stuck in prisons
With scarcely enough for a blunt
Or the pressure of blood
That new hotel in the hood
With an oligarch's name on the front

[Chorus]
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages

Eight years old and he’s kicking and screaming
“I’ll only go to school if you give me a reason
The kids are really mean and I already know all the things they’re teaching”
Hopped in the car mama let him play hookey
Missed the first hour just to get a cup of coffee
She’s the only one who saw who he was, no one else could read him
Showing up late but he makes it to class
Just to stare out the window and the clock in the back
He daydreamed away to a sky so gray
Everything’s simple, it’s driving him mental
Wishing every day that something would change
Instead his dad makes him play ball by the bay
And every time he cries, father rolls his eyes saying
“Son it’s all your fault, how come you never try?”

[Pre-Chorus]
He does all that he should
Why is he misunderstood?

[Chorus]
This is a story bout a broken boy
With his headphones in just to block out the noise
Of everyone around him telling him the way to go
So he walks the world alone
Wondering if it gets better
Or if he’s always gonna feel empty forever
So he gets lost tryna find another way back home
As he walks the world alone
[Verse 2]
Fifteen years and he’s drowning his sorrows
Smoking weed, drinking cheap liquor out the bottle
With a bunch of fake friends 'cause he tried to fit in but it wasn’t working
Ran in with the law 'bout a dozen of times
Nothing too bad, just a few suburban crimes still
He says to himself, “What are you doing you don’t deserve this
Don’t you know nobody will ever understand
The person that you are, learn to hold your own hand
Get your shit together and lose the weight
You’ll never be what you want, no not with that face”
He started writing all of his thoughts on paper
Realized music made life so much greater
100 pounds down, he looks so different now
As he plans his escape from a crooked hometown

[Pre-Chorus]
He does all that he should
Why is he misunderstood?

[Chorus]
This is a story bout a broken boy
With his headphones in just to block out the noise
Of everyone around him telling him the way to go
So he walks the world alone
Wondering if it gets better
Or if he’s always gonna feel empty forever
So he gets lost tryna find another way back home
As he walks the world alo-oh-oh-oh-oh-one

21 years and he’s on the right path
But sometimes he wonders if he grew up too fast
And missed out on the little things, all of the little things
(Haha, yeah right)
Who is he kidding, surely not himself
But sometimes he wonders if there’s somebody else
Who takes the same road, but he’ll never know
'Cause he walks the world alone

[Chorus]
This is a story bout a broken boy
With his headphones in just to block out the noise
Of everyone around him telling him the way to go
So he walks the world alone
Wondering if it gets better
Or if he’s always gonna feel empty forever
So he gets lost tryna find another way back home
As he walks the world alo-oh-oh-oh-oh-one

How I miss you breathing on my neck when I enter

You would listen to my lies and go believe in me
'Cause honestly you couldn't think of ever leavin' me
And that might be a better option, but I needed you
When you needed me
When I was sick in that bed, you had treated me
Don't let me fade away, away, away
I tried to come back for your love, but you seated me
But I understand your every single reasoning
You always tie it all together like a seasoning
